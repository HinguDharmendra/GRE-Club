	Once you are done sending your applications by the month of December or at the most January, the long anxious wait for the outcome begins. Admits (or rejects) start flowing in from mid February and can keep coming till the second week of May or sometimes even later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	After you receive the responses of all the universities you had applied to, choose the best possible admit from them (this can especially become tricky if you have to choose between two similarly ranked Universities)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	&nbsp;<em><strong>Tips on finalizing THE university from the admits:</strong></em></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>
		Try to get in touch with some seniors who are currently pursuing their graduation from that university and course. Ask your seniors about pros and cons of the universities you wish to select.</li><br/>
	<li>
		Know about the Job prospects (which is the prime reason you&#39;re going there), ranking of the university, weather conditions&nbsp;and location of the city/town (read safety and happening life).</li><br/>
	<li>
		And last but not the least, get in touch with your classmates/batchmates who are joining that university so that you can &lsquo;enjoy&rsquo; the higher studies as well.</li><br/>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Along with an &lsquo;admit&rsquo; the universities also sends you a form issued on your name called the &ldquo;I-20 Form&rdquo;. It is a document issued by the university to the students who have been granted admission and tells the US government that you are eligible for F-1 Student Status. You should receive this via post within 3-4 weeks of receiving the &lsquo;admit&rsquo;. Only after receiving this I-20 you are eligible to appear for VISA in student&rsquo;s category (F-1 Visa). If you do not receive it within the stipulated period you must get in touch with the concerned authorities of the university to speed the process of getting it.</p>

	<strong>NOTE</strong>: Some universities require you to send a few documents like Affidavit, Bank Statement, Financial support, etc. for verification only after which the I-20 Form is processed.
