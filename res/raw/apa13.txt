	Generally, all universities expect you to give three LoRs. Moreover, a letter of recommendation should ideally be drafted by the recommender himself/herself. Unfortunately, every recommender is so <em>lazy and less interested</em> that the applicant is forced to draft on it&#39;s own and will finally be moderated by the recommender.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Now, the next question will be - <em>what should I write in my LoR?</em> So we enumerate the following points:</p>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<em>First Para:</em> Write about your recommender&rsquo;s qualification and the time since s/he knows you and is serving the institution.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<em>Second Para:</em> Highlight your academic details under that teacher, how you have performed in his/her subject. Write marks and more importantly write it in percentage (<em>Example</em>: s/he stands in the top 5% of the class)</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<em>Third Para:</em> This will vary from recommender to recommender. If you&#39;re taking one from the project guide, you can describe about the project and your incredible role in the same. Similar is the case with publications, presentations, internships and work experience.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<em>Fourth Para:</em> Please flaunt as much as you can in this paragraph. This is the extracurricular section, so write about all your achievements in the last three years (Event Head, worked for this and that committee, Sports, etc.)</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<em>Last Para:</em> Keep it small (say 2-3 lines) and it should conclude the above points and tell the university to grant him admission along with Financial aid.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<em>Bottom Left of Your Draft:</em> Your teacher&rsquo;s name, signature &amp; stamp, qualification and his/her post in the current institution/company.</li><br/>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<em><strong>Warning</strong></em>: Don&rsquo;t make the LoR so exceptional that you are the best student in India. Make it quite real and cover the above mentioned points.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<em><strong>NOTE:</strong></em> Split the content in the LoRs so that all three are different from each other.</p>
