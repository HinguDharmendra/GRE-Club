		If you feel a counsellor is going to reduce your work, then you are highly mistaken. You <em>still</em> have to do all the hard work; they just guide you along the way. It is a form of spoon feeding, no doubt about it.</p>

		Don&rsquo;t get carried away by their tempting talks as they give you a lot of hope before joining them and in the end you may find that you didn&rsquo;t get all that was promised.</p>
