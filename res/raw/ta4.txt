	If you ever want to test your patience level, try and give the TOEFL exam. It&rsquo;s a bloody four hours long examination and often the time duration will increase due to technical errors. The longer the examination, the lesser is its preparation.</p>
<p>
	Preparing for Toefl isn&rsquo;t as tedious as GRE. A week or 10 days is more than sufficient. There is no need to solve any books for TOEFL. Directly, start off with the computer tests like Barron&rsquo;s, Kaplan and Cambridge.&nbsp; Each of these tests will have individual section of reading, listening, speaking and writing. Solve each section independently and get a hang of all the questions. Notice the type of questions as it is important to get familiar with the type.</p>
<p>
	- <strong>Reading</strong> section is pretty simple as it asks you basic questions which can be solved in less than 15 seconds. The only exception in reading is the last question. This question is pretty complicated, time consuming and difficult. But it offers you 3-4 points as well unlike the other questions. GET IT RIGHT!</p>
<p>
	- <strong>Listening</strong> is altogether a new section. You haven&rsquo;t been exposed to this section in any part of any exam. So preparation is also required. It isn&rsquo;t a difficult section but all you need to do is CONCENTRATE. You need to understand the accent in which they speak. If you are a regular follower of Hollywood movies or Star World shows, the ball is in your court. &nbsp;You will hear a series of conversations or lectures and you will be asked questions based on it.</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Important</em>:</strong> Jot down points while listening to the conversation as you don&rsquo;t get a second chance to hear the same.</p>
<p>
	- <strong>Speaking</strong> is one of the important sections and preparing for it will be fun. It&rsquo;s the shortest section of TOEFL but requires enough preparation. On presenting the 6 tasks to you followed by the questions, WRITE DOWN SOME POINTS while reading or hearing the questions in this section. They expect you to repeat some of the IMPORTANT words. Solve all the questions from Barron&rsquo;s. If time and mood permits, solve Kaplan and Cambridge.</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Note</em>:</strong> Students generally score less or sometimes the least in this section. Make sure you do well here as the university often grants you TEACHING ASSISTANTSHIP (TA) based on your speaking exam.</p>
<p>
	- <strong>Writing</strong> section doesn&rsquo;t require you any preparation. You will be happy to reach this section as the horrible 3 hours will soon be over.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the same part which you have been preparing since childhood days - ESSAY. Just see the type of the essays from Barron&rsquo;s. If your writing and expressing skills are brilliant, you can excel in this section.</p>
