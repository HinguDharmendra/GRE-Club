<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	Ohio State University, Ohio</h1><hr style="text-align: justify;" /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Preface:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Ohio State University is a public research university located in Columbus, which is, obviously, in the state of Ohio. Founded in 1873, OSU is the third largest university campus in the United States of America. OSU is considered one of the better universities when it comes to Computer Engineering and also Networking.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Location:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Columbus is a small town in Ohio, and to be honest, there isn&rsquo;t too much near it either. Cincinnati is about 100 miles away, and it&rsquo;ll take you 4-5 hours to drive to Pittsburgh or Detroit, the &lsquo;big cities&rsquo; nearby.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Infrastructure and Residing options:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Ohio State University is built on a massive 1764 acre campus, and the architecture is a quite wonderful mix of traditional, modern and post-modern styles. At OSU, you&rsquo;ll see some brilliantly designed buildings with interiors to match. The library system has over 5 million volumes, and more than 20,000 are added every year. The research centers and lecture halls are terrific, and the recreation center really is a sight to marvel at.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Off-campus housing is generally the preferred option, and for a change it&rsquo;s also the far cheaper option. Once you&rsquo;re able to find yourself a couple of roommates, you could look around the area and find some place that suits your requirements &ndash; rest assured there will be many. 15<sup>th</sup> Avenue and Chittenden Avenue are some of the more student-friendly areas around, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that there aren&rsquo;t any more. About $200-300 per month per head should ensure a pretty cool place, provided, of course, you aren&rsquo;t too late.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Weather: </strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Oh it&rsquo;s quite terrible. Even if you go live in the Himalayas for a few months and acclimatize yourself to the biting cold, you would never be able to prepare yourself for the horrible tornadoes, with speeds of upto 90kmph, that often hit Columbus. The weather is extremely unpredictable and unfriendly, showing insane amounts of yearly, and even daily, fluctuations in rainfall, temperature and snowfall. In a nutshell, hope for the best and prepare for the worst.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Courses Offered:</strong></em></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Aerospace Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Biomedical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Business Logistics Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Civil Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		City and Regional Planning</li><br/>	<li>		Computer Science and Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Electrical and Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Food, Agricultural and Biological Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Industrial and Systems Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Materials Science and Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Nuclear Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Welding Engineering</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Faculty and Pedagogy:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Some students aren&rsquo;t terribly pleased with the way things operate at OSU, since deadlines often change without much notice, and syllabi aren&rsquo;t always perfectly adhered to (like in Mumbai University, where books are made after the syllabus is released). But this in no way means that the pedagogy is bad; OSU isn&rsquo;t a top 25 university for nothing. Most of the professors are excellent in every possible way, though there may sometimes be a tiny communication gap, but that too is nothing that can&rsquo;t be bridged with ease.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Fees:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The tuition fee at Ohio State University is about $30,000 per annum which is a bit over the top for a public university. Anyway, given the name OSU, it&#39;s worth the money.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Financial Aid:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Well, not too much. They seem to believe (and rightly so) that the relatively fee is generous enough. However, scholarships aren&rsquo;t completely impossible to get, provided a - you need it, and b - you deserve it. This can be done by a - not being too rich, and b - keeping your grades high enough.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Eventual Placements:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Placements at OSU are rather good. Top IT firms like IBM and Accenture are regular recruiters. But like anywhere else, you have to be good at what you do in order to deserve a top job.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Crowd and Campus Life:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	One thing that you certainly can&rsquo;t complain of when at OSU is loneliness, or a lack of like-minded people. The sheer size of the university ensures that you can find people (yes, of both sexes) just like yourself, be it in terms of caste/creed/colour or interests. There are more than enough places to hang out and do things you like, both on and off campus, The Oval being one of the most popular bird-watching points, and the, ahem, libraries being some of the most common spots to pick up a date. Of course, when things don&rsquo;t seem to be going your way at college, you can always run down to Downtown Columbus or Brewery District, both of which are always bustling with nightlife. Typical university life, this.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Vyomesh Joshi</em> - Executive VP of HP Imaging and Printing Group</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Larry Sanger</em> - Co-founder of Wikipedia</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Charles Kettering</em> - VP of Research at General Motors, Founder of Delco, invented electric starter for automobiles</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Verdict:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Excellent option for Computer engineers provided you can stand the weather, of course.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Website:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.osu.edu/" target="_blank">www.osu.edu</a></p>
