<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	State University of New York &ndash; Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo)</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Preface:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	University of Buffalo, a public research university started in 1962, is the largest university among all the SUNY universities. Again, this is one of the hot favourites among all Graduation students due its amazingly low fees and strategic location. Almost every Indian applies to this college after reading the above the lines (Don&rsquo;t be ashamed, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong in that).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Location:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Although the name very generously mentions New York, don&rsquo;t be under the tremendously flawed notion that you&rsquo;ll be right next to Manhattan. You couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong. Although Buffalo isn&rsquo;t really a village, it&rsquo;s not what you can call a massive city. As for cities to visit once you&rsquo;re there, well you&rsquo;ll be pleased (not really) to know that Hamilton and Toronto (which are in Canada!) are a shorter drive away than New York City is. Best of luck.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	SUNY Buffalo is somewhat divided into three different locations/campuses. They are: &lsquo;Amherst&rsquo; where the North Campus is located, &lsquo;Heights&rsquo; surrounded by hundreds of shops and big brick houses in the South Campus and &lsquo;Buffalo&rsquo; itself. The campus on a whole is spread over 1350 acres. The architecture of the university looks like it&rsquo;s come straight out of a 70&rsquo;s movie, especially the North and South Campus. The university contains nine main libraries having more than 3 million volumes of all possible topics/courses in the world.<br />	Grad Students prefer to live off campus in places like University Heights, Parkside and Allentown where the charges are around $750 per month.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Weather: </em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Oh, it&rsquo;s pretty cold. Buffalo is known for its winters as it&rsquo;s extremely snowy. The UB students are pretty excited about the snow, but perhaps not the biting cold. Anyway, skiing more or less becomes the &lsquo;national sport&rsquo; of Buffalo for those 4-5 months. The winter climate is extremely difficult to handle and there&rsquo;s always a time in one&rsquo;s life when he&rsquo;s willing to beg/borrow/steal/murder or just migrate for some sunshine.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Aerospace Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Biochemistry</li><br/>	<li>		Bioinformatics and Biostatics</li><br/>	<li>		Biological Sciences</li><br/>	<li>		Civil Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Electrical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Management Information Systems (MIS)</li><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Industrial Engineering</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	SUNY Buffalo is one of the most productive research universities in the States, and naturally credit goes to its professors. But there are a few &lsquo;not completely amazing&rsquo; professors, like anywhere else, and students tend to avoid their classes. Some are pretty helpful and go out of their way for students. All in all, SUNY Buffalo is well known for its research work, less low and soaring reputation, so really, how much does the faculty matter?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Fees:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	SUNY Buffalo charges an amazingly reasonable tuition fee of just $10,000 per semester (12 credits). Roughly it will cost you $30,000 for the entire course.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Financial Aid:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Come on, isn&rsquo;t the awfully low fee enough? We&rsquo;re here to cater to your need, not your greed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	That being said, the university is still nice enough to dish out a few need-based scholarships. Plus, you can always obtain Teaching Assistantships or Research Assistantships at Buffalo. How very nice of them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Eventual Placements:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Being one of the major universities in the state of New York, SUNY Buffalo certainly offers excellent placements. Fantastic job profiles with excellent packages are there for the taking, you just have to make sure you do enough in your time at college to get them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	At SUNY Buffalo, you can be sure of a mixed, multicultural crowd, with a slight majority of Asians. Every student can certainly find more people like oneself, so life shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Unfortunately there is no bar on campus but there are a few Coffee shops like Perks, Starbucks and Tim Horton&rsquo;s.<br />	The nightlife is SUNY Buffalo is pretty awesome! Famous areas for pubs and bars are Allentown, University Heights, The Chippewa Strip, and The Elmwood Strip. UB favourites include Alternative Brews, Broadways Joe&rsquo;s, The Steer, Just Pizza, Mighty Taco, Duff&rsquo;s and Amy&rsquo;s Place. There are a plenty of 24*7 restaurants like Denny&rsquo;s IHOP, Pano&rsquo;s, Towne and Lake Effect Dinner.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Ronnie James Dio</em>- EVERY METAL FAN WILL KNOW THIS NAME</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Christopher Scolese</em> - Chief Engineer at NASA</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Bram Cohen</em>- Creator of bit Torrent</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Verdict:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	SUNY Buffalo certainly ranks pretty high in the rankings for most courses, but somehow it&rsquo;s not completely impossible to get in. Should be one of the universities one should look to get into, especially if the fees is a deciding factor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Website:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank">www.buffalo.edu</a></p>
