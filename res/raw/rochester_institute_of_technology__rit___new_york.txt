<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Preface:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Rochester Institute of Technology is a private research university started in 1829. RIT&rsquo;s strategic location &ndash; New York &ndash; somewhat puts it amongst the better universities around by default. It is arguably one of the favourite among Indians and almost 100% (yes, 100%!) of the students who apply make it to this university. It is almost the last but a confirmed choice for every Grad student. An average, maybe below average profile should blindly apply to Rochester Institute of Technology.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Location:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	RIT is located several miles away from the city of Rochester near Genesee River in Henrietta in New York. Rochester is the third largest city in New York, hence multiple opportunities are always just around the corner. Though the immediate area nearby the campus is quite dull, the state of NY more or less makes up for it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The RIT campus is spread over a massive 1300 acres with almost 250 buildings in it. The architecture is a gives a typical brick-building look, hence, students fondly call the University a &lsquo;brick-city&rsquo;. There is only one, but a huge, library by the name &lsquo;Wallace&rsquo; which has books of all the possible subjects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	RIT has over 13 dorms on campus whose charges are around $6500 per year. Graduate students prefer to stay off campus, though, in areas like Erie station, Park Point and Rustic village where the charges range from $700 to $1200 per month.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Weather: </em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	If you arrive at Rochester in fall, the weather is pretty much tolerable but as it progresses towards November, it becomes extremely cold with temperatures going well into the sub-zero zone. RIT often experiences a lethal combination of wind and snow. Summers are okay, if they show up.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Applied Statistics</li><br/>	<li>		Biomedical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Bioengineering</li><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Computer Science</li><br/>	<li>		Electrical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Engineering Management</li><br/>	<li>		Game Design and Development</li><br/>	<li>		Industrial Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Information Technology</li><br/>	<li>		Manufacturing Leadership</li><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Medical Informatics</li><br/>	<li>		Microelectronic Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Material Science Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Product Development</li><br/>	<li>		Software Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Sustainable Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Systems Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Telecommunications Engineering Technology</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Students are more or less satisfied with the level of education at RIT. The professors are highly knowledgeable and pretty friendly too. Students are surprised, and pleased, by the fact that professors are so approachable in spite of being involved in their own high levels of research.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Fees:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	RIT charges a tuition fee of roughly $19,000 per semester.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Financial Aid:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Despite a private university, RIT does shower you with a lot of grants and scholarships at the time of admissions (around $8,000 per semester) to fund your education. You can take up Teaching Assistantships and Research Assistantships, which should go some way in helping you out financially.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Eventual Placements:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Well, the placements are decent, though nothing out of the world. Major recruiters are IBM and Microsoft, but that&rsquo;s the case almost everywhere.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The crowd at RIT is surprisingly multicultural, given the plethora of Indians applying to it. This is perhaps because of the fact that most Indians who secure better universities tend to join them. You would find a nice mix of students from different cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. You&rsquo;ll also find at least a few students who share your interests, or just about any interest in the world.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	As for places to hang out, there is a bar in Ritz which is located within the campus along with two cafeterias, Beanz and Buzz Shop. RITites are often seen partying or &lsquo;enjoying&rsquo; in downtown Rochester at places like Tap Room, Tiki Bob&rsquo;s Cantina and MacGregors Grill. Inspite of many colleges in Rochester, the nightlife is not at all up to the mark as the pubs are overcharged or they close before 2.00 AM in the night. Highland Park Diner, Jay&rsquo;s Diner, Pita-Pit and Mykonos Caf&eacute; are the hot favourite restaurants among the RIT students.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Verdict:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Definitely one of the schools you should apply to, but perhaps only as a safe bet. If you can do better, you probably should aim higher.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Website:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.rit.edu/" target="_blank">www.rit.edu</a></p>
