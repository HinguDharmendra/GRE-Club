<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	George Washington University (GWU)</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Preface:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	George Washington University is a private research university located in Washington DC, which is it&#39;s USP if you ask us. Founded in 1821, GWU is one of the universities most average students apply to, so that they can at least study in an awesome city if not such an awesome university.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Location:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Like we said, the location of George Washington University is probably the best thing about it. The urban campus is located at the wonderfully named Foggy Bottom area of DC, which means you have the world at your disposal. Well not literally, but you get the idea. If you ever plan to get out of the city, all of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York are not too far away.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Infrastructure and Residing Options:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The surprising thing here is that although he&#39;ll of a lot of money is spent on facilities, the basic infrastructure - lecture halls, classrooms, laboratories - aren&#39;t exactly up to the mark. Everything else though, is quite exceptional. They have brilliant facilities for all sports and athletics, a huge library which has everything you could need, and a great, state of the art gym.<br />	Many students at GWU live in the dorms, but many more live off campus. There are a number of places around college where you can din accommodation, though it doesn&#39;t come very cheap. The smartest thing to do would be to find some people to share a house with, and then go looking around for one - preferably slightly away from college, if you don&#39;t want to end up spending too much.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Biomedical Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Civil and Environmental Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Computer Science</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Electrical Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Energy Engineering and Management</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Engineering Management</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Engineering and Technology Management</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Environmental Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Structural Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Systems Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Telecommunications Engineering</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Weather:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Washington&#39;s climate isn&#39;t too great - summers are quite hot, while winters can get really cold, especially when the chilly winds set in. Basically, you need to be prepared for all kinds of weather. That includes rain; DC receives a fair amount throughout the year, so carry an umbrella.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Now, George Washington University is by no means among the top universities in the States, especially for engineering. Somehow, though, the professors here are quite fantastic - highly qualified and highly experienced. It doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to figure out the reason - DC, if you were still wondering. Professors share a good rapport with students, though sometimes it becomes difficult to get personal attention, simply because of the sizes of the classes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Fees:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	This is where things get scary. GW charges a prohibitive tuition fee of about 50,000 dollars for the entire course. Madness!</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Financial Aid:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	At a college that charges a frightfully high fee, you&#39;d expect some amount of decency when it comes to scholarships. Apparently not, it seems. Yes, it&#39;s possible to get some funding, but it&#39;s never easy, unless you have a strong (academic) case for it.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	You won&#39;t find a great big number of Indians here, for two reasons - one, it&#39;s not that great a university. Two, it&#39;s bloody expensive. That&#39;s a dangerous combination which sends it tumbling down the Indian Ranking System. However, you&#39;ll still find a fair few Indians, who&#39;ve come here simply for the DC tag (just like you might, if you end up there). And fair enough, because there&#39;s some great cultural, social, and religious diversity here. Washington DC after all.<br />	As for things to do other than slogging your butts off, there are plenty! The concept of hanging it at college doesn&#39;t really make sense, since there&#39;s so much to do once you step out. Hundreds of bars, restaurants and cafes ensure that you never have to go back to a place you don&#39;t like. And travelling is pretty convenient too. Perfect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Placements and Internships:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	You don&#39;t have to be TOO worried about finding a job, but if you want to worry about something, it might be smart to start with your academics. You&#39;re definitely going to have a harder time looking for a job if you have awful marks than if you&#39;re a topper, so that&#39;s something you should aim for. Everything else falls into place automatically, since they have quite a decent Career Centre, which provides high quality guidance and help.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Abby Jospeh Cohen</em> - MD of Goldman Sachs</li><br/>	<li>		<em>John Cherbini</em> - Partner at KPMG</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Kun-Hee Lee</em> - Chairman of Samsung Group</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Verdict:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	If your aim is a big city rather than a big college, George Washington University is pretty much made for you. Though you could probably aim for some better colleges in New York anyway.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Website:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.gwu.edu/" target="_blank">www.gwu.edu</a></p>
