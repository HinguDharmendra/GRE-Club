	This is by far the most common question you would hear from a student applying for MS. Ideally, the application process should begin by <em><strong>November first week</strong></em>. Generally, engineers apply during this time as after a month they have to go through the university exams which is stressful. In other words, all the documents required for the application should be ready by the start of November.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	As soon as you have shortlisted your universities, start filling the online application forms. Generally, the deadlines are around mid December for most universities, though some have in January, a couple of them have it in March and some have a <em>rolling admission process.</em> Earlier you apply better it is, as many universities have two deadlines - <em><strong>General </strong></em>and<em><strong> Financial aid</strong></em> which falls<sup> </sup>between second week of November and first week of December.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	In short, if you are applying for Fall 2013, then you should start applying anytime post October 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<em><strong>Note</strong>: </em>You get a financial aid only if you apply to a respective university before its &lsquo;financial aid deadline&rsquo;. Secondly, you are eligible for an F-aid if your scores, academic marks and achievements are marvellous.</p>

	<em>Is applying early to a university an advantage?</em> Answer is <em>mostly</em> No. Good universities review the applications after the deadline. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you should delay your admission process. Few of the good universities start evaluating the applications as and when they receive it. This is known as &lsquo;Rolling Admission&rsquo;. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example</span>: University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). The advantages of an early application are that if you satisfy the criteria of the university you will get a admit at the earliest irrespective of other applicants.</p>
