<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware</h1><hr style="text-align: justify;" /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Preface:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	University of Delaware is a privately chartered university, albeit with some state assistance as well, which makes it a unique private as well as a public university. Established as early as 1743, UDel has its main campus in Newark, Delaware. Although it is considered a gettable university, thanks to excellent intake, you shouldn&rsquo;t read much into this since it&rsquo;s a really good school, which is greatly helped by its strategic location. Speaking of which&hellip;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Location:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Newark, Delaware should not be confused with the capital of New Jersey, but fortunately has an equally good location. Not the biggest of cities by itself, Newark is helped by the fact that all of Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington DC, New York and the real Newark are within a hundred mile radius of it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The suburban campus of UDel spreads across about 2,300 acres and is divided into seven sections, one being engineering of course. Many of the buildings and research laboratories are newly constructed and are really sights to see with state-of-the-art equipment as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	One thing you should know before you rent a house is that Newark isn&rsquo;t terribly safe. It would make sense to look at places which are near campus and which are easily accessible. Cleveland Avenue and East Main Street fulfill these criteria and therefore are understandably the preferred off campus areas to live. If you start early enough, it shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to find yourself a nice place with rent anything between $400 to $1,200 per month.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Weather: </em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Although to be unfair to say that the climate is bad, everyone agrees that it is tremendously unpredictable. Cold, torrential down pours during summer and blizzards during winter aren&rsquo;t very uncommon. But all in all, it&rsquo;s not too bad since summers aren&rsquo;t sultry and winters are quite mild. Spring is definitely the best season, when the campus is breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Courses Offered:</em></strong></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Bioinformatics</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Civil and Environmental Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Computer and Information Science</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Electrical and Computer Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Materials Science Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Ocean Engineering</li><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The engineering faculty at University of Delaware is known primarily for its exploits in the field of Chemistry, although students say that all professors are really really good. Professors are extremely understanding, very helpful, and are more than willing to go out of their way for their students.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Tuition Fees:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The damage at UDel is roughly $15,000 per semester/term.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Financial Aid:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Difficult, but not impossible. You&rsquo;d had better present a good enough case for it, though, and by that we&rsquo;re talking about your acads.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Since UDel is a pretty large school, you can expect to find students of all colours, shapes and sizes, and you&rsquo;ll be surprised by the number of beautiful people you find here. The undergrads, especially, are known for their hotness. Don&rsquo;t get scared, though &ndash; you won&rsquo;t be an outcast even if you aren&rsquo;t a looker. People here are generally quite friendly and adjusting, and if you drink it&rsquo;s a big big bonus. Drinking is almost a religion here, which is why you see a number of bars in the otherwise residential areas around. So if you get out of your house on a random weeknight and you find a hot, very inebriated girl asking you for a ride back home, don&rsquo;t start pinching yourself &ndash; it isn&rsquo;t a dream.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>John P.Costas</em> - CEO of UBS Investment Bank</li><br/><br/>	<li>		<em>Larry Probst</em> - Chairman of the Board for Electronic Arts (EA)</li><br/><br/>	<li>		<em>Scott Levy</em> - Professional wrestler known more popularly as &quot;Raven&quot;</li><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Verdict:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Not the best university in the world, but probably the best in Delaware. That&rsquo;s not saying too much, of course, but if you have an average profile, you could do better than not apply here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Website:</em></strong><a href="http://www.udel.edu/"><em><strong> </strong></em></a></h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.udel.edu/" target="_blank">www.udel.edu</a></h3>
