		You can/should get all the I-20s of the admits that you&#39;ve received and then decide which university you want to go. <em>There is nothing wrong and the VISA Officer won&#39;t reject you on this basis.</em></li><br/>
	<li>
		Book your VISA slot once you&#39;ve received the I-20 and have confirmed on the final university.</li><br/>
	<li>
		Do not lie to the VISA Officer as s/he has the basic information about you and your family. Be smart and tackle tricky questions.</li><br/>
	<li>
		Prepare well if you&#39;ve low academics, GRE and TOEFL score. Give reasons which sound sensible. Try to justify those reasons and at also show how you made up for the same.</li><br/>
	<li>
		If you&#39;ve a year gap post undergrad education and have done absolutely nothing in this period, make sure you&#39;ve sufficient reasons to tackle their questions.</li><br/>
	<li>
		Focus on the research work of the university that you&#39;re going to join.</li><br/>
	<li>
		Always ask for reasons if the VISA Officer rejects you.</li><br/>
	<li>
		A day (preferably 3 weeks) before the intreview, PLEASE check for all the documents required for VISA Interview.</li><br/>
	<li>
		Some say university tag (which is absolutely true) matters a lot, some leverage on GRE, and some might have other reasons. But the best way to ace the VISA process is be CONFIDENT and SMILE <em>(not giggle)</em> constantly.</li><br/>
