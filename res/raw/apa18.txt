			Don&rsquo;t boast about your achievements, especially marks. Put it in a subtle way. Write more on how that particular achievement helped you and spurred you on.</li><br/>

			Your SoP shouldn&rsquo;t highlight your interest in working in an MNC or earning heavily in<em> dollars</em>. It should hit your goals and targets. It should be inclined towards your interest in the course and the respective university.</li><br/>

			Don&rsquo;t make it too long and boring on a particular topic. Understand that a reader is a man and not a computer.</li><br/>
		<li style="text-align: justify;">
			Make sure you keep your SoP in a safe locker. Don&rsquo;t share your SoP or the idea of it with anyone<em>. </em>The people reading your SoPs are experts and will surely be able to identify copied SOPs.</li><br/>
