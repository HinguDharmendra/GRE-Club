	<em>Conditional admit</em>: If you are applying to a university without your TOEFL score, it&rsquo;s perfectly ok but it&rsquo;s always better if you&rsquo;re done with it. When you apply to a university without a TOEFL score, it gives you a conditional admit which means that you have take your TOEFL exam for the confirmation of the admission. If your TOEFL score is low, then the respective admission committee will either tell you to repeat the exam or take up a course in their institution and complete it. The course isn&rsquo;t a part of your regular curriculum and it becomes hectic. Moreover, it&rsquo;s very expensive. So repeating TOEFL is the right choice.</p>
