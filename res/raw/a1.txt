	Students planning to pursue Masters of Science, commonly known as MS, take the GRE - <strong>Graduate Record Examination</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Post July 2011, the GRE pattern has changed and the exam is no longer a computer adaptive test </em></span>but the performance in the given section will determine the level of the next section.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	New GRE has 2 sections for GRE Verbal and Quantitative. Each section is considered as one stage. First Section is Stage 1 (or called as Routing Stage). Depending on your performance, the test taker is routed to one of several alternative second-stage tests, each of which consists of a fixed set of questions and differs on average difficulty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	If you get high score in Section 1, your entire set of questions in Section 2 will be under Difficult (or very difficult) category. This makes the<em> New GRE difficult to crack</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>Examples:</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<span style="line-height: 1.5;">1. You get Quant section first. You solve all the questions which will be a mixture of easy, moderate and difficult. Assuming you did really well, your next section, say Verbal, will be more difficult. If you perform badly, your next section will again be easy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	2. Moderately difficult level of questions will be given to you in Section 1. Based on your performance, you will get one of Easy, Moderate and Difficult in section 2.</p>
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Score 165 in Section 1 then you will be routed to Difficult Level in Section 2.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		If you score 135 then you will be routed to Easy Stage 2.</li><br/>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Another variation can be</p>
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Stage 1: Moderately Difficult</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Stage 2: Very Easy, Easy, Moderate, Difficult and Very Difficult</li><br/>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>Myth:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	You should solve the first few questions (the first 8-9 questions) taking as much time as required and get them right.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">This is not true. It depends on the level of questions. You should not blindly follow this logic and lose too much time so that you do not have enough time in the end to solve the remaining questions which may turn out to be easier. It&#39;s &ldquo;suicide&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>Must do:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	You SHOULD attempt all the questions even though you might have to mark an answer without spending enough time on it because an incomplete paper can cost you a loss of significant points.</p>
