<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	Oklahoma State University, Stillwater</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Foreword:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Oklahoma State University is a public research university founded in the year 1890. It was originally known as Oklahoma Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College (<em>similar to everyone&rsquo;s favourite TAMU</em>). Sometimes referred as OKState, is at best a mid-level tier-2 university. The Princeton Review rated it among the top 50 &ldquo;Best Value Colleges-Public&rdquo; for the year 2010. Over the last 3 years, it has become one of the most preferred universities for Management Information Systems (MIS) for an average profile under his/her &#39;safe&#39; bet.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Location:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The main campus is located in the town of Stillwater. The town is well known largely because of the university itself and has nothing much outside it. However, many students feel that there is a lot you can do to keep yourself engaged in and around campus. The nearest big city is the state capital, Oklahoma City itself which is roughly 70 miles from Stillwater.</p><p>	&nbsp;</p><h3>	<em><strong>Infrastructure &amp; Residing Options:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Oklahoma State University is ranked among the top across the States in terms of infrastructure facilities like libraries and student centres. Here we would like to specifically mention the facilities and atmosphere for athletics which is absolutely great. The college of engineering or CEAT, as they call it, has a relatively new addition called the <em>Advanced Technology Research Centre</em> which has concentration in fields like web handling, energy storage and conversion, manufacturing and other fields as well. The Edmond Low Library is the crown jewel among all libraries among the universities in Oklahoma.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Weather:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	One thing that most people have to say about the OKState weather is: UNPREDICATABLE. The weather simply does not remain stable for more than 3 or 4 days. There isn&rsquo;t much of extreme weather because of that and if you&rsquo;re worried about snowing, then fear not, because this is one place where surely the snow will not pile up taller than humans.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Courses Offered:</strong></em></h3><ul>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Chemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Civil and Environmental Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Electrical and Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Industrial Engineering and Management</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Engineering Technology Management</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Management Information Systems</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Telecommunication Management</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Faculty &amp; Pedagogy:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The faculty here does have an interest in teaching and imparting knowledge to others. The number of teaching assistants and their constant guidance in the course is especially mentioned here by the students. However, on the down-side some professors are not very approachable and not helpful and they &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t care less&rdquo; if you existed or no but if you do show them some interest and respect there is a high chance you may be rewarded with some research work or project.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Tuition Fee:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Being a public university, OKlahoma State charges a song for its graduate program which is $728 per credit hour. The number of credits required for your Masters degree is approximately 27-32 thus, making the total tuition fee approximately $22,000. Pretty cheap, if you ask us!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Financial Aid/Scholarships: </strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Good profiles will definitely be rewarded with financial aid at the time of taking admission. Since it&#39;s a mid-tier university and has a public status, the chances to get a Financial aid is really high. Internship scenario is decent after one year completion of Masters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Eventual Placements:<br />	</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The location leads to the placements taking a hit. Good students should push for placements off-campus by visiting career and job fairs outside. Nevertheless, there is still some campus placement where the average placement package was about $50,000-$60,000.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Crowd &amp; Campus Life:<br />	</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The crowd at Oklahoma State University is not, too, diverse with about half of it being from the country itself; you&rsquo;ll find a handful of Asians. The crowd is known to be very friendly and you&rsquo;ll surely find someone or the other who has matching interests. There are a large number of girls who are &ldquo;outgoing&rdquo; in the words of some of the people we interacted with.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	There is a strong culture for athletics in the college which people love to indulge in and cheer for their home team. Also, on the bright side is the fact that the nightlife and partying scene is pretty good compared to most other colleges across USA. So, those keen on having a good time can surely put their doubts to rest. For those with tricky taste buds, the off-campus dining options are highly varied and one won&rsquo;t have to keep returning to the same place again-and-again. Jack in the Box and House of Greek are some of the more popular restaurants.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Famous Alumni:</strong></em></h3><ul>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Dr. H. Edward Roberts &ndash; Inventor of the PC</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Gordon Eubanks &ndash; CEO and President, Symantec Coporation (<em>Makers of Norton AntiVirus</em>)</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Verdict:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	For an average student Oklahoma State University can be considered as a safe admit. The low fee and plausible chances of ascholarship can be a plus for you but keep in mind the location and the tough placement situation and the extra effort you may have to put in for the same when you take your final decision.</p>
