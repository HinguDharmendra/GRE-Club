<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	San Diego State University (SDSU)</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Introduction:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	San Diego State University (SDSU) is a public flagship research university founded in 1897. Being located in California, it has a decisive advantage over other lower rung colleges of the States, so most students in Computer Science (CS), Electrical and all the circuits and chips branches will be having this university among the lower preferences or as most would like to read - &#39;safe&#39;.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Location:<br />	</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	This is one factor which maybe drawing you towards SDSU. The campus is located in the heart of the city of San Diego itself. The proximity to Silicon Valley, the software capital of the world is probably a strong asset to this university.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Infrastructure &amp; Residing Options:<br />	</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The campus has beautiful infrastructure on the whole with an ultra-sleek pedestrian bridge, Open Air Theatre, Aztec Bowl stadium and the Malcolm A. Love library which has almost 5,00,000 books. The library has numerous sub-sections dedicated to various fields including an extensive map collection, children&rsquo;s literature and a &ldquo;special collection&rdquo; section. Apart from this major library there are numerous smaller ones also. The college of engineering offers centres of research like combustion research laboratory, energy analysis diagnostics and a few others as well in other disciplines.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	To be very frank about the off-campus housing options at San Diego, we have to say that it will be EXPENSIVE with even a studio apartment going at around $1000. Be rest assured that there will be vacancies available for you to stay though. Although it&rsquo;s not much favoured, on-campus housing is also an option with 7 odd, Aztec style named dorms available to students which provide all the necessary amenities for living.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Weather:<br />	</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The students of SDSU swear that the weather here is one of the best in the whole country. It is sunny throughout the year with occasional rains. It&rsquo;s the typical weather where you can go and chill out by a pool or the beach for most part of the year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Courses Offered:<br />	</strong></em></h3><ul>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Aerospace engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Bioengineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Civil engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Electrical engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Engineering with Business (Inter-disciplinary)</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Mechanical engineering</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Computer Science</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Faculty &amp; Pedagogy:<br />	</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	To be very honest, the faculty is not over-the-moon like the ones you&rsquo;ll find in other Californian T-Schools. Some of them are knowledgeable and engaging in their way of conducting lectures but students rate them slightly above average only. There are good chances for students of CS or EE to get projects under the guidance of the faculty since the professors will be having work in tandem with the bigwigs of Silicon Valley.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Tuition Fee:<br />	</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The tuition fee for the entire course at SDSU will be approximately $25,000 per annum which, mind you, is pretty cheap.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Financial Aid:<br />	</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	SDSU being a public university, there is always a chance for TA/RA and other scholarships. Owing to the university in California and that too being a public one, they will be flooded with applications. In case you intend to nail a scholarship then a complete or well-rounded profile is a MUST.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Eventual Placements:<br />	</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Firstly, understand the fact that you study in CALIFORNIA. You are virtually guaranteed a placement especially if you are in CS, EE or the business courses. Numerous career fairs with other career related services sessions are a part of the culture here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Crowd &amp; Campus Life:<br />	</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	At SDSU, you are sure to find people who are career-oriented and all fired up to do extremely well in every walk of life. Some of them will be the typical coding, programming type people wanting to hit jackpots in Silicon Valley. Good looking guys and girls are very common in the university.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	There are numerous places where a party will be happening, Karl Strauss and The Bitter End are some of the more popular bars to hang out at. Off-campus dining options vary from places like The Cheesecake Factory to Souplantation (TBBT anyone?) and numerous other ones which serve sushi, Japanese and cowboy cuisine.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Famous Alumni:</strong></em></h3><ul>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Gregory Peck (Go watch the movies Mackenna&rsquo;s Gold and MacArthur)</li><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Robert O. Peterson (Founder of Jack in the Box chain of fast food restaurants)</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Verdict:<br />	</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Definitely not the top university; San Diego State University may hover around top 10 of the state. However, the state in which it is located does matter A LOT. For those intending to do CS or EE, can keep it as a mid-level option and the ones in Mechanical and other core branches can put it a few rungs lower or maybe even give it a pass. This of course is predicated on the basis of how strong your profile is.</p>
