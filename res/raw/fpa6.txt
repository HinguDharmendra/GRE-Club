<p>
	All your hard work has been paid off and it&rsquo;s time to bid adieu to India and leave for the States. You&rsquo;ve successfully managed to cross all the hurdles right from GRE to the Applications, never-ending wait for the Admits and the nerve wrecking VISA interview/s.<br />
	<br />
	Now before you leave for a new country, there are obviously a lot of things you need to consider as you&rsquo;re going there to study and NOT FOR A HOLIDAY. Moreover, you&rsquo;re going to stay alone (<em>okay, we know it&rsquo;s fun</em>) from your home. So, we&rsquo;ve done all the homework for you. Get your shopping shoes on, get the credit cards ready because it&rsquo;s time to spend on shopping.<br />
	<br />
	Here is a general guideline to do everything before your departure:<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong><em>HEALTH</em></strong></p>
<hr/>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Full body check-up: Treatments are very expensive in the US, in particular Dental and Eye Care</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Immunisation: Each university has its own list of mandatory vaccinations, so check that out and start early</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Insurance: Travel insurances are offered by many Indian companies. However, a full health insurance from your university is highly recommended as Indian policies don&rsquo;t cover everything and the claim process is much difficult.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Medicines: Get as many basic tablets as possible. Some of them are expensive in the US
		<ul>
			<li>
				Cold, Fever - Crocin</li><br/>
			<li>
				Body Pain - Crocin, Combiflam</li><br/>
			<li>
				Indigestion, Gastric Problems - Gelucil, Zinetac</li><br/>
			<li>
				Throat Infection - Erythromycin</li><br/>
			<li>
				Allergies - Avil .25</li><br/>
			<li>
				Vomiting - Avomine</li><br/>
			<li>
				Tooth Ache - Combiflam</li><br/>
			<li>
				Cold, Head Ache &ndash; Amurtanjan, Crocin, Vicks</li><br/>
			<li>
				Stomach Pain - Cyclopam</li><br/>
			<li>
				Sprain - Esgypyrin</li><br/>
		</ul>
	</li><br/>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p><strong><em>TICKETS</em></strong></p>
<hr/>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Book your tickets immediately after you receive the I-20 and book your Visa interview (Generally in the month of May end/June first week)</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Try getting a single direct flight if possible</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		If it is not working out/expensive, then make sure you leave at least 3-5 hours gap between the arrival of the first flight and the departure of the next.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Some travel agents give discounts on group bookings</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		If you&rsquo;re amongst those who miss your mom a lot (certainly you&rsquo;ll in the first few months), then it is recommended to book a return ticket (for December). If not, be prepared to shell a lot of money if you book in the last minute in December.</li><br/>
</ol>

<hr/>
<p><strong><em>LUGGAGE</em></strong></p>
<hr/>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Total linear dimensions of each check-in bag should not exceed 158 cm (62 inches).</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Total weight must not exceed 23 kgs (50 pounds). Again, this varies from flight to flight but anything around 23 kgs should do good for you.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		You are allowed to carry one hand baggage plus a briefcase, laptop, purse.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Maximum weight of hand baggage should not exceed 8 kg (variable).</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Students with I-20 are allowed to carry 3 bags each of 23 kgs on some airlines.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		It&rsquo;s generally a good practice to split luggage amongst your frien</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		The most preferred brands are: American Tourister (AT), Samsonite, VIP.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		VIP is the cheapest but quality is OK. American Tourister is mid-range but the quality is very good. Samsonite is very expensive. Choose the ones which is the best for you.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		There is hardly any difference between hard and soft cases. Stick to soft ones as hard ones get easily scratched too.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Transportation Security Administration (TSA) locks are a must.</li><br/>
</ol>

<hr/>
<p><strong><em>CLOTHES & APPAREL</em></strong></p>
<hr/>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Take a few pairs of clothes with you as finding a laundry or washing them will be difficult till you settle down in the apartment</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Pack a few casual t-shirts, jeans, few formal shirts and trousers, one suit and tie and some shorts and a traditional dress</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Other than this, pack some towels, napkins, belts, handkerchiefs, formal and casual shoes, sneakers, socks.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Warm clothes are a must. Take clothes that you can wear in layers. Sweaters will also do.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Blankets (only if you don&rsquo;t get sleep without it), bed sheets and covers. You may completely skip this point if your luggage is exceeding.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Avoid packing oily stuff in the baggage</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify; ">
		Take one nail-cutter, scissor, comb, your shaving kit, toothbrush and toothpaste.</li><br/>
</ol>
