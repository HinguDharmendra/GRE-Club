<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	University of Connecticut, Storrs (UConn)</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Preface:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The University of Connecticut is a public research university located in Storrs, Town of Mansfield, which is in Connecticut, of course. UConn, as it&rsquo;s commonly called, was founded in 1881 and has millions of courses, but only a few that our readers would be interested in. A number of Indians do apply here, but more often than not it&rsquo;s just a case of &lsquo;if nowhere else, then UConn&rsquo;.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Location:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The town of Storrs is a completely rural town (though it&rsquo;s not really a &lsquo;village&rsquo;, you know. They have power and water and all). It&rsquo;s a nice place for students, with lots of options for outdoor activities, but nothing like a city. Fortunately, Boston is about 70 miles away, while both NYC and Philadelphia are within 200 miles.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The architecture at UConn is a mixture of old and new buildings. The college is constantly updating its facilities to keep the school ahead of other nearby public universities. The chemistry and business buildings are state-of-the-art, and the library and the Student Union promote a great learning environment. All facilities are kept very clean, as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Although the most popular places to live off-campus (almost everyone lives off-campus) are Celeron and Carriage, there are much quieter, cheaper options available a couple of miles away from college. This isn&rsquo;t much, considering how it&rsquo;s healthy to walk, and whatnot.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Weather:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	There&rsquo;s nothing exceptional about the weather at UConn, and most Indians would find it quite a bit like home. Apart from the occasional snow, of course. Summers are quite warm, bordering on hot, and winters seem cold only because of the winds. It rains for a good part of the year, so it&rsquo;s always advisable to carry an umbrella with you.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Biomedical Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Civil Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Computer Science &amp; Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Electrical Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Environmental Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Materials Science &amp; Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Polymer Science</li><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Fees:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	University of Connecticut charges a tuition fee of about $14,000 per semester (+9 credits).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Financial Aid:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	It&rsquo;s not too hard to get some kind of scholarship, especially if you have respectable academics to back yourself.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	As in any other university, there&rsquo;s a decent mix of students from various cultural and economic backgrounds, but you&rsquo;ll definitely be able to find your place here. There&rsquo;s not a terrible amount to do near college, and that&rsquo;s probably why they have three pretty cool bars on campus. Thirsty Dog and Huskies are the two more popular ones, though Ted&rsquo;s is the place to be if you&rsquo;re a sports lover. Other than that, there are millions of parties every night, but you just have to find the right places, for which you&rsquo;ll need to find the right people.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Robert Diamond</em> - Former President and CEO of Barclays Bank</li><br/><br/>	<li>		<em>William S. Simon</em> - President and CEO of U.S.Operations for Walmart</li><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Verdict:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	One of the colleges an average student applies to, but University of Connecticut is certainly not a university you should put at the top of your list.</p>
