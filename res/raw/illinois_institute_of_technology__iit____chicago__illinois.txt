<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) &ndash; Chicago, Illinois</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Preface:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Illinois Institute of Technology is a private research university located in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded in the year 1940, when the erstwhile Armour Institute of Technology and Lewis Institute merged into one. Although you wouldn&rsquo;t find this school in anyone&rsquo;s Top 5 list, it&rsquo;s actually pretty good for Electrical and Computer Engineering. This, coupled with the fact that it&rsquo;s in full-of-opportunities Chicago, makes it a decent choice for students with not-so-great profiles. Also, it has a pretty high acceptance rate, so most students can expect to get it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Location:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The one thing that makes IIT so popular is its location. Chicago has been voted as one of the best cities in the world to live in, and it&rsquo;s one of the major financial capitals as well. It&rsquo;s also a hugely busy city, which would be very clear when you see the endless activity. To add to all of this, it&rsquo;s extremely safe (well, most of it). Full marks for location, although one thing that may not agree too well with you is the weather&hellip;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Weather:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Well, Chicago is rightly called &lsquo;The Windy City&rsquo;, and we&rsquo;re sure you don&rsquo;t need an explanation as to what that means. However, what you do need to know is that these winds are of the Very Chilly variety. The climate is pretty cold for at least eight months a year, and you also have to deal with high amounts of snowfall. Temperatures can fall below -15 degrees Celsius once in a while! Summers are pretty pleasant in comparison, but you&rsquo;ll still end up wearing at least a jacket even then.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Infrastructure and Residing Options:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	When it comes to housing, almost all grad students choose to live off-campus. Everyone advises their juniors to start looking well in advance, since all the newer (and thus better) houses get gobbled up pretty quick. The rent you pay isn&rsquo;t a joke, but it&rsquo;s far, far less than what you&rsquo;ll end up paying if you choose to live on campus. Most students try living nearer the city, although that increases your travelling time a bit, but it seems worth the trouble since it&rsquo;s much safer, and there&rsquo;s a lot more to do there.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Courses Offered:</h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Master of Biological Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Chemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Food Process Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Science in Chemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Science in Food Process Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Science in Computer Science/Master of Chemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Science in Civil Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Science in Environmental Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Architectural Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Construction Engineering and Management</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Environmental Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Geotechnical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Geoenvironmental Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Public Works (Infrastructure Engineering and Management)</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Structural Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Transportation Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Biomedical Imaging and Signals</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Electrical and Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Electricity Markets</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Power Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Science in Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Science in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Science in Electrical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Telecommunications and Software Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of VLSI and Microelectronics</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Science in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Science in Materials Science and Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Science in Manufacturing Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Materials Science and Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Master of Engineering in Manufacturing</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Fees:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The college charges a slightly lofty tuition fee of approxiately $38,000 for the entire course ($1,200 per credit).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Eventual Placements:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Now the jobs you get hugely depend on the course you&rsquo;re doing, and even more on your performance in the course. Since Chicago has a world of opportunities, yes you&rsquo;ll probably end up with a job, but it may or may not be to your liking. Don&rsquo;t forget that IIT isn&rsquo;t the greatest of universities, and if there&rsquo;s another recession (which seems likely every once in a while now), just hope that it doesn&rsquo;t get caught out in the cold when it comes to placements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Crowd and Campus Life:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	You&rsquo;ll find an alarmingly large number of Asians at IIT. This should seem normal for most graduate programs, but the difference here is that there&rsquo;s a massive influx of Asians even for the undergrad programs. Students are allegedly less interested in outdoor activities (sports, for example) and more interested in indoor activities (video games. Oh god). And of course, the boy/girl ratio is about 4:1. Engineering, we tell you.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	As for hangouts, well there&rsquo;s the whole of Chicago waiting to be discovered. There are a few decent bars near the school, but a lot more options are available if you&rsquo;re willing to take the bus or train to a couple of miles away. It might be a pain finding agreeable company though &ndash; most students are happy just staying home, murdering their books and complaining about not getting time to do anything.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Martin Cooper</em> - Inventor of the mobile phone</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Sanjay Kirloskar </em>- Chairman and MD at Kirloskar Brothers Ltd.</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Rajeev Chandrasekhar</em> - MP, Member of the team which designed the Pentium chip, Founder of BPL Mobile&nbsp;</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Verdict:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Not the best school Illinois, not even the best school in Chicago. But Illinois Institute of Technology isn&rsquo;t a bad option for someone who&rsquo;s not got the best of acads but still wants to study in a good place. And by that, we&rsquo;re talking about the city.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Website:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.iit.edu/" target="_blank">www.iit.edu</a></p>
