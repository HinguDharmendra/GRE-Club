			You can start off with a quote that has inspired you the most. Though it is not needed as the adcom knows that you&#39;re certainly not inspired by it, still many applicants do write (in like 2 lines).</li><br/>
		<li style="text-align: justify;">
			<em><strong>First Para</strong></em>: Describe your childhood interests in an innocent way (don&rsquo;t drag it for long) and how that interest is still in you.</li><br/>
		<li style="text-align: justify;">
			<em><strong>Second Para</strong></em>: Highlight your undergrad percentage (make sure the achievement is big, else don&rsquo;t) in a subtle manner. Also, write about your current subjects that inspired you towards the course and express it as one more element towards your interest.</li><br/>
		<li style="text-align: justify;">
			<em><strong>Third Para</strong></em>: Give an idea of your Final Year Project and explain what you are learning from it rather than boasting about your project. Explain your publications, internships in the same way as your projects.</li><br/>
		<li style="text-align: justify;">
			<em><strong>Fourth Para</strong></em>: This is the most important paragraph. Don&rsquo;t bore the reader by praising them irrelevantly. Express your liking of the university in terms of Research work, Labs, Faculty, and current Projects. You&#39;ve to cater to three primary questions in this paragraph -
			<ol>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">
					Why have you decided to choose the USA? (Okay, everyone knows it&#39;s the fat pay package but you can&#39;t mention it, of course.)</li><br/>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">
					Why have you opted for this course and university?</li><br/>
				<li style="text-align: justify;">
					What have you liked about the university? (<em>not only pertaining to the course but a general liking</em>)</li><br/>
			</ol>
		</li><br/>
		<li style="text-align: justify;">
			<em><strong>Fifth Para</strong></em>: Explain your goals-short term and long term, where you see yourself some years down the line. Express the content in this paragraph pretty well (one of the crucial factors that decide if you get your admit.)</li><br/>
		<li style="text-align: justify;">
			<em><strong>Last Para</strong></em>: This is the concluding paragraph (in 2-3 lines) saying that you will serve really well in the respective university and will bring a lot of value to the institution and your home country.</li><br/>
	</ol>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">
		<em><strong>Important Note:</strong></em> You have to make as many rough drafts as the number of universities you are applying to. All the content more or less remains the same except the paragraph where you describe the specific university. So, finish the common parts as early as possible and then start searching for particular university as mentioned in point no. 5.</p>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">
		<em><strong>Tip:</strong></em> First and Last sentence of every paragraph is very very important as the evaluator won&#39;t spend more than a minute on your essay. So, s/he might skim through the SoP and would focus on the first/last sentences of the paragraph which can decide your result.</p>
