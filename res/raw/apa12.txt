	Usually, the recommenders are from your undergraduate institute (your respective department especially) and work/internship place (if any). <em>So, does designation of the recommender matter?</em> Honestly, it does. You can&rsquo;t take a recommendation from a teacher who has just joined the institution and has an experience of a year or two. An LoR from your institution&rsquo;s dean or principal holds a lot of weightage. An LoR from the company&rsquo;s manager makes a difference. In most applications, following are the recommenders -</p>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Your final year project guide</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Professor who has taught you during your undergrad course and you have scored well in that subject</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Any project guide/companies you have worked</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Project Managers/Corporate Officials where you&#39;ve worked/interned.</li><br/>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<em><strong>Recommendations cannot be given by:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Peers/Friends/Relatives</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Any random personality you met in a conference</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Parents</li><br/>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<em><strong>Note:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		It would be great if you can get an LoR from a Math Professor if you are applying for a Financial Engineering course.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Make sure that you are on good terms with your recommenders. If not, then try improving them. Learn Buttering. Don&rsquo;t force your teachers to write good about you (if you succeed, lucky you). Always remember, they are doing a favour to you.</li><br/>
</ol>
