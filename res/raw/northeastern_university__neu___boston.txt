<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	Northeastern University (NEU)</h1><hr /><p style="text-align: justify;">	<em style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.2;">Preface:</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Northeastern University is a private research Institution located in Boston, Massachusetts, started in 1898. It&rsquo;s a popular university amongst Indians. Most of the courses offered by this university are highly rated, and we believe that this has a lot to do with its strategic location.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Location:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	NEU is located in Downtown Boston, which is definitely one of the busiest and exciting places in the world. Nearby you also have Boston University, which means that you are in the midst of about 2,00,000 students at any given point of time. Quite astonishing, really.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Northeastern University has often been considered a model of design for urban universities and has twice won the Most Beautiful New or Renovated Exterior Space Award.&nbsp; It has a fantastic recreation centre, complete with a gymnasium and courts for basketball, volleyball, badminton and futsal. The library was opened in 1990 and consists of a whopping 1.3 million volumes. The campus also has a Spiritual Life Centre and Sacred Space.<br />	Although the university does provide accommodation for International students, yet most Asians prefer living off campus for affordability reasons. The standard Off Campus areas to stay are Allston, Back Bay, Fenway, and Jamaica Plain where the charges are $800-$1000 per month.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Weather: </em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Boston has snowy weather for a major part of the year. Fall is the best period as the temperature is quite average and bearable. Sometimes, it snows during summer. Weird!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Bioengineering</li><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Civil Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Computer Systems Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Electrical and Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Engineering Management</li><br/>	<li>		Energy Systems</li><br/>	<li>		Industrial Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Information Systems</li><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Operations Research</li><br/>	<li>		Telecommunication Systems Management</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Northeastern University faculty members are world renowned and have also achieved international recognition for teaching and research. Among their faculty are a former Presidential candidate, a Pulitzer Prize Winner and other highly decorated scholars.<br />	Northeastern University is known for its integration of classroom learning with real world experience. The university houses for more than 35 research and education centres.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Fees:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The tuition fee at NEU is approximately $50,000 for the entire course ($1,500 per credit for 32 to 36 credits). It&#39;s, of course, worth the money.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Financial Aid:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Being a private university, and a pretty good one, NEU isn&rsquo;t exactly too generous when it comes to dishing out scholarships. But you can certainly get by if you don&rsquo;t mind giving some time to Teaching Assistance or Research Assistance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Eventual Placements:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Northeastern University has really good placements. A large number of fortune 500 companies such as Microsoft, Intuit, Proctre &amp; Gamble, Disney, etc. visit the campus and offer excellent packages.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Life at Boston is, well, awesome! Innumerable places like Boston Common, Chinatown, and Fenway Park are very common with the NEUites. Roxy Nightclub and Tiger Lily are the favourite pubs, but that changes every few days, to be fair. Boston House of Pizza, P.F. Chang&rsquo;s, The Cheesecake factory, T.G.I.F and Cappy&rsquo;s Pizza are the favoured restaurants among the NEU hoi polloi.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Richard Egan</em> - Co-founder, EMC</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Biz Stone </em>- Co-founder, Twitter</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Bob Graham</em> - Former EVP, Sun Microsystems</li><br/></ul><p>	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Verdict:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Fantastic university, even better city. Should be within your sights if you have a decent profile, and should certainly be a preferred option.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Website:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">www.northeastern.edu</a></p>
