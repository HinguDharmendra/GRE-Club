<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC)</h1><hr style="text-align: justify;" /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Preface:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	University of North Carolina at Charlotte, usually referred as UNCC or simply Charlotte, is a public research university founded in 1871. The university is pretty famous for its Electrical Engineering and Computer Science programs and is always on the application list of an average profile. UNC of Charlotte is a hot favourite university for Asians, especially Indians, considering the strategic location and easily affordable fees.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Note: </em></strong>UNCC is not to be confused with University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and the latter is any day a notch above the former.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Location:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Located in the second largest banking sector of the States, Charlotte is the largest city in the state of North Carolina. Though students usually dream to get an admit from the elder brother NCSU, UNCC is one of the colleges in the USA or probably any part of the nation, which is hugely famous for thousands of business start ups. Thanks, to its location and the best financial background.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Nicknamed the Queen City, Charlotte is located several miles east of the Catawba River and southeast of Lake Norman, the largest man-made lake in North Carolina.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Spreading over a small 250 acres, UNCC has one of the best campuses in the States. Starting from the Student union, to the library which have millions of volumes of all possible books, from cafes and bars to the high class and well maintained gymnasium, the university has every possible thing you want under the sun.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	As the overall land space in the college is pretty less, students prefer to stay off campus where the rental charges are roughly around $8,000 per year depending upon the size of the room and the number of roommates.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Weather: </em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Charlotte, like other southeastern states has a humid subtropical climate. Winters are short and generally mild while the summers are extremely warm and humid. Though snowfall is rare, students are pretty happy with the climate from late November to January. The only advantage at Charlotte in terms of climate is that it never experiences extreme temperatures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Courses Offered:</em></strong></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Civil Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Electrical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Engineering Management</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The academic teaching at UNCC is pretty excellent. While you meet professors who have done their PhD&rsquo;s from the best institutes in the world, you meet a lot of Nobel laureates and multiple degrees. Students are pretty satisfied with the teaching level of the professors. Teachers are highly co-operative and easy to approach provided you attend the lectures regularly. Professors are helpful during projects, obviously you&rsquo;ve to make a move.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Tuition Fees:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Being a state funded university, UNCC is extremely light on yours (or daddy&rsquo;s) pocket. You&rsquo;ve to shell out roughly $10,500 per semester (<em>9 or more credits</em>) which is almost equal to doing an MBA in India.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Financial Aid:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	As the name suggests, the university is a public university sponsored by the state North Carolina. Thus, you can expect a good amount of F-aid, provided your profile is worth a waiver. Research and Teaching Assistantship (RA &amp; TA) are easily gettable if you&rsquo;re up to date in your submissions, term exams and communication skills.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Eventual Placements:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Even though the college isn&rsquo;t highly ranked in the States, the eventual placements are quite above average compared to the universities of the same league. As mentioned earlier, being the best banking sector of the country, you can expect enormous placements in the field of banking, finance, mutual funds in world class MNC&rsquo;s with a whopping salary from anything around $35,000.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The crowd at UNCC is pretty above average with an equal sex ratio, we mean boys and girls. Since, the university is located in a pretty busy area of Charlotte; the night life of this college is quite commendable. Students are seen partying in the downtown Charlotte in pubs and restaurants like Butter, Phoenix and Suite.<br />	Though most of the students prefer to discotheques and pubs, you&rsquo;ll find a major number holding a house party every weekend!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Verdict:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Though UNC Charlotte is not in the big league of colleges and is always preferred after NCSU, the high class city, excellent economical background, tolerable weather, and extremely low fees, make this college on the wish list of just an about average profile.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Website: </em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.uncc.edu/">www.uncc.edu</a></p>
