		The evaluator has never seen you or heard of you. So, the SoP serves the purpose of telling the admission committee why they should choose you. It is &ldquo;the&rdquo; most important document. They want to know a student in and out and not just by his transcripts and final year project. An SoP carries a lot of weightage. A well written SoP, particularly for the top universities, can tilt the scales in your favour.</p>
