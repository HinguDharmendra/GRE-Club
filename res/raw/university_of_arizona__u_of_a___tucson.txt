<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	University of Arizona, (U of A), Tucson</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Foreword:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	University of Arizona is a public research university founded in the year 1885. This university is a favourite among Indians especially for the Management Information System (MIS) course which is offered by the highly-rated Eller School of Management. The Systems and Industrial Engineering program is ranked 10th across the States, thereby showing that this college is also a force to reckon with.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Location:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	U of A is located in the small city called Tucson. The nearest major city is Phoenix which is the state capital. Phoenix is located about 110 miles from U of A campus. Tucson is the second largest city of the state and is largely known for its cultural and literary scene.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Infrastructure &amp; Residing Options:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	To begin with let us mention the campus library which has over 6 lakh books and Apple Macintosh workstations for the students. There are a number of campus book stores as well. There is also a Student Memorial Centre whose architecture is similar to that of the ship USS Arizona. The athletics facilities are also noteworthy here, since the university has regular participation in the Pacific-12 and NCAA conferences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	The dormitories and halls are numerous and can be passed as easily liveable as told to us by the various students. The problem with off-campus housing is the difficulty in finding them; however, if you are lucky enough to find one, the damages won&rsquo;t be too much at all. Living expenses at Tucson would vary from $400 to $1000 per person per month depending on your number of roommates and luxury.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Weather:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	There is practically only one season - SUMMER. It&rsquo;s sunny throughout the year and sometimes the heat tends to become intolerable. Since it is a desert, winters tend to be very cool (<em>recollect the concepts of geography you may have crammed a decade ago</em>) and provide a change to the otherwise hot weather.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Courses Offered:</strong></em></h3><ul>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics</li><br/><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Electrical and Computer Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Engineering Management</li><br/><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Industrial System Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Management Information Systems</li><br/><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Mining, Geological and Geophysical Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Systems Engineering</li><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Faculty &amp; Pedagogy:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The faculty at University of Arizona is highly appreciated by the students. They are known to be highly knowledgeable and generate a lot of interest in the subject among the students. A special mention here for the faculty of the Eller School of Management which conducts the MIS course. Students are very happy with these professors who are friendly enough to help them out to even get internships.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Tuition Fee:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The fee per semester is roughly $10,000 which is moderate by American standards. However, the fees for MIS will be higher since it comes under the purview of the B-School where the I-20 amount is $60,000 per year. In any case, the tuition fee for the entire course would hover around $30,000.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Financial aid/Scholarships:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Scholarships at University of Arizona are easily (<em>assuming you&#39;ve a good profile, of course</em>) available in the graduate engineering college but they will be very difficult to obtain in the school of business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Eventual Placements:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The campus has an active career services unit which works actively towards getting students recruited. The placements especially for the MIS program are pretty good. Microsoft and Raytheon Group are known to hire students from UofA regularly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Crowd &amp; Campus Life:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The students at U of Arizona have varying interests ranging from politics to economics and business. The crowd has a large number of American citizens and a splattering of others from here-and-there which will give you a taste of cultures of the globe. It would be heartening for the boys to note that there are numerous girls around thanks to the numerous departments present within the university.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	There are a number of partying options for those of you&rsquo;ll who don&rsquo;t mind travelling to the various party hubs. Quantity wise there&rsquo;s always a place to visit with numerous house and frat parties almost every night. The foodies won&rsquo;t face problems here for sure with a number of regular jaunts to visit from the regulars like Papa John&rsquo;s and Starbucks to places like Taco Bell and Canyon Caf&eacute;.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Famous Alumni:</strong></em></h3><ul>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Robert Woods Johnson IV &ndash; Founder of Johnson &amp; Johnson</li><br/><br/>	<li style="text-align: justify;">		Nicole Richie</li><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Verdict:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	This should definitely be on your list if you&rsquo;re looking for a good MIS course which will provide you with great opportunities. For the other programs you could relegate this to a secondary option despite there not being any serious problem that we see, it&rsquo;s just that others are slightly better.</p>
