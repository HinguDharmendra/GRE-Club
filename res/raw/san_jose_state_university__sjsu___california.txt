<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	San Jose State University (SJSU)</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Preface:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	San Jose State University is a public research university located in San Jose, California. Founded in 1857, it&rsquo;s the oldest public university on the West Coast of the USA. SJSU also boasts the highest foreign student enrollment in the whole of the United States, which in a nutshell means that it&rsquo;s not really too much of a task to get in.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Location:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	While San Jose is a pretty cool place to live in by itself, it&rsquo;s also helped by the fact that there are a number of equally awesome places to visit if you want to get out, say on a weekend. Oakland, San Francisco and Sacramento are all within a couple of hours driving distance from the university.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Built over 150 acres, the SJSU campus has a nice blend of some nearly-ancient and some very recently constructed buildings. There is a great amount of history behind what the campus looks like today, complete with fires and earthquakes and mass demolition. But the one thing that cannot be doubted is that the infrastructure is excellent, and the facilities are top-notch. They have a fantastic athletics center near the main campus, and they have a stunning 8-storey library which won the Library of the Year award in 2004. Magnificent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	When it comes to living off-campus, one thing you should remember is that, unfortunately, there are sometimes safety issues in San Jose. Burglaries and minor crimes aren&rsquo;t uncommon, and there have been cases of muggings as well. So it&rsquo;s perhaps worth the extra few dollars per month if you live in a better neighbourhood, because you&rsquo;ll probably be looted of that much anyway if you choose a cheaper area.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Weather: </em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Well, it&rsquo;s California. The climate is just like the Mediterranean which, if you&rsquo;re wondering, means that it&rsquo;s amazing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Aerospace Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Bioinformatics &amp; Bioengineering</li><br/>	<li>		Biomedical Devices</li><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Civil Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Electrical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Human Factors &amp; Ergonomics</li><br/>	<li>		Industrial and Systems Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Materials Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Quality Assurance</li><br/>	<li>		Software Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Electronic Materials and Devices</li><br/>	<li>		Electronic Packaging</li><br/>	<li>		Engineering Management</li><br/>	<li>		Environmental Health and Safety</li><br/>	<li>		Manufacturing Systems</li><br/></ul><p>	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Now, San Jose State is certainly not among the best schools around, and it certainly doesn&rsquo;t have the kind of professors that, say, UC-Berkeley or UIUC or Stanford has to offer. But what this university CAN boast of, is the fact that all the professors are highly dedicated and committed, and are more than willing to do anything in their considerable power to help students.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Fees:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Definitely one of the cheaper schools around, SJSU charges roughly $6000 per semester as its tuition fee.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Financial Aid:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Since it&rsquo;s a public university, scholarships are possible to obtain, but they&rsquo;re never easy to come by. You have to maintain rather high academics throughout, plus you need to, well, need the scholarship. What&rsquo;s much easier to get is a teaching or research based assistantship.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Eventual Placements:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	While we&rsquo;re going to be honest and admit that we couldn&rsquo;t find much information about how good or bad the placements at SJSU are, what we CAN tell you is that their career center is quite brilliant. Most students get placed quite well, and the career center goes out of their way to ensure that the &lsquo;career fairs&rsquo; are successful.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Since the school has such a massive intake, you can be certain to meet a wide range of people from different cultural, geographic and socio-economic backgrounds. One thing is certain &ndash; you will definitely find enough people who you can relate to.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	As for things to do when you aren&rsquo;t drowned in your books (or a pool of booze), well there&rsquo;s no place better than San Jose to start exploring California. There is something for everyone, be it bars, coffee shops, the beach &ndash; it has it all.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Ed Oates </em>- Co-founder of Oracle Corporation</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Jon Iwata</em> - Senior Vice President of IBM</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Donald Beall </em>- Retired Chairman and CEO of Rockwell Automation</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Verdict:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	While it&rsquo;s possible that you could aim higher, San Jose State University is by no means a bad school. Oh, and there&rsquo;s no place like California.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Website:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/" target="_blank">www.sjsu.edu</a></p>
