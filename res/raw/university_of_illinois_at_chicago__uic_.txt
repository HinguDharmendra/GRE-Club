<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)</h1><hr style="text-align: justify;" /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Preface:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	University of Illinois at Chicago is a public research university founded in 1858 and located in the large city of Chicago. UIC, ranked in the Top-50 universities in the United States, is one of the common graduation colleges which you find on the list of every average profile. The university gets a lot of applicants from Asia and is generally preferred by Mechanical Engineering students.<br />	Note that, UIC is <strong><em>not the same</em></strong> as UIUC (University of Illinois &ndash; Urbana Champaign) and the latter is, how do we say this, rather better.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Location:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	UIC undoubtedly has one of the best locations for a school in the US of A. Chicago is third largest populated city in America after New York City and Los Angeles and is considered as one of the busiest and safest cities in USA.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The campus size at UIC is roughly about 311 acres, which is quite massive for a campus in the middle of a big city. The university has three main libraries covering more than thousands of volumes of all the possible courses. Apart from the excellent academics offered by the institution, there is a recreational centre within the campus where you find most of the students chilling. There&rsquo;s also a theater, and a number of coffee shops within the campus.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Most of the graduation students prefer living off campus as the apartments are bigger, less expensive than inside the campus, and for other obvious reasons (read privacy). Greektown and Little Italy are the common areas where you see UIC students residing where the charges start roughly from $550 upto $2,000 depending upon the size of the room.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Weather: </em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Well, Chicago is quite popular as &lsquo;The Windy City&rsquo; because of its one sided weather. The climate in this beautiful city is cold to chilly for 8-10 months of the year. Winters are horrible as the temperature falls way below -20 degrees followed by snow. Summers are bearable, still students are seen wearing jackets and sweatshirts during most of the year. All in all, weather is one of the &lsquo;not-so-good&rsquo; factors of this college, yet students are in love with the city.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Courses Offered:</em></strong></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Bioengineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Bioinformatics</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Civil Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Computer Science</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Electrical and Computer Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Industrial Engineering/Industrial Engineering and Operation Research</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Materials Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Management Information System</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Everyone at UIC must be cursing the college&rsquo;s luck. Because, if UIUC (the neighbours at Urbana-Champaign) didn&rsquo;t exist, UIC would definitely have been the best college in Illinois. As things stand, however, it gets somewhat stepbrotherly treatment. But that&rsquo;s only from casual observers, since anyone who knows would know pretty well that the faculty at Chicago is rather excellent. The brilliant location ensures that the college attracts the best of professors from all across the world. The research facilities at UIC are terrific, and just about everything about the colleges academics is top notch.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Fees:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	UIC is a public state funded university, and charges a tuition fee of about $12,000 per semester.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Scholarships:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	As the college is funded by the state of Illinois, students tend to get some financial aid in University of Illinois, Chicago provided your profile is worth it. Having said that, students definitely get a good Research and Teaching Assistantship along with part time jobs, considering the great prospects of this city.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Eventual Placements:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Perhaps the strongest advantage UIC has over most colleges in the country is its extremely strategic location. Chicago is one of the biggest cities in the world, and the fact that it&rsquo;s full of opportunities pretty much ensures that you&rsquo;re quite sorted (in terms of getting a job, not getting stoned/smashed) if you&rsquo;re studying at UIC.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Students are usually quite busy with the rigorous academic work and research yet they party every week, sometimes twice a week. When you&rsquo;re in the city of Chicago, you aren&rsquo;t left out with options. The UIC campus has multiple places to check out followed by hundreds of local bars and cafes off campus where you see UIC students spending their days (oh, nights too). Downtown, Navy Pier, Lake front, Wicker Park are the common and popular areas for the state students to hangout. Students are in love with the nightlife at UIC as there are many discotheques and bars according to themes like Zentra, V Live and Bon V.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Adrian D.Smith</em> - Designer of the Burj Khalifa, Trump International Hotel and Tower and Jin Mao Tower</li><br/><br/>	<li>		<em>Anuradha Acharya </em>- Founder and CEO of Ocimum Bio Solutions</li><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Verdict:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	While it&rsquo;ll be unfair to mention its name in the same breath as UI-Urbana Champaign, UI-Chicago still is an excellent university nevertheless. Oh and the location really helps.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Website:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.uic.edu/uic/" target="_blank">www.uic.edu</a></p>
