<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	University of Texas at Austin (UTA)</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Preface:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Founded in 1885, University of Texas at Austin is one of the most prestigious schools in the USA. It is a public research university, and is the flagship institute of the University of Texas System. UTA is a dream university for a number of students thanks to its history, and the excellent future it promises. However, it isn&rsquo;t an easy task to get in, unless you have an absolutely outstanding profile, complete with impeccable academics, a couple of international publications, and extensive research work.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Location:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	As the name quite clearly suggests, the University of Texas at Austin is located at, well, Austin in Texas. Being the &lsquo;live music capital&rsquo; of the world, Austin witnesses a massive number of concerts week in week out. It&rsquo;s a nice, laid-back place, where the major modes of transport are bikes, cabs or just foot. Shuttle buses are available within the university, though.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Most graduate students live off-campus, because it&rsquo;s cheaper and you get a little more freedom (though Indians wouldn&rsquo;t be used to even the on-campus levels of freedom; they stay off-campus only for one reason). Three major off-campus options are West Campus, North Campus and Riverside, of which West is quite expensive. The other two are slightly more affordable, but they&rsquo;re further away from the UTA campus.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Of course, one should also take into consideration the appreciable crime rate when renting a house in Austin. It&rsquo;s not that bad, really, but things do happen.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The UTA campus is spread over 350 acres, complete with all sorts of state-of-the-art facilities for anything you can think of. They have 17 huge libraries, having over a million publications between them. There are as many as SEVEN museums within the campus! There is a bar within the campus (oh yes, you read it right) called Cactus Cafe, and a Starbucks Caf&eacute; as well. They also have a bowling alley, and a quite fantastic movie theatre.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Although most graduate students prefer staying off campus, the San Jactino and Jester dorms are the ones to die for if you&rsquo;re living on campus.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Weather: </em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Austin, Texas experiences nine months of summer, two months of fall, and just a solitary month of winter. Although the weather is unpredictable, the winters aren&rsquo;t really cold. Summers can get really hot though, and roaming around in shorts, with your shirt buttons left open is considered quite normal. Yuck.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Aerospace Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Environmental Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Architectural Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Bioengineering</li><br/>	<li>		Biomedical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Civil Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Electrical and Electronics Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Petroleum Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Material Science Engineering</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	University of Austin &ndash; Texas is one of the most popular universities around, and you don&rsquo;t have to look beyond the faculty and the research facilities to gauge why. Among the faculty are recipients of the Nobel Prize, the Pulitzer Prize, the Wolf Prize, and the National Medal of Science. A lot of emphasis is laid on research, and the institute&rsquo;s infrastructure has been designed in such a way so as to make research an absolute joy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Fees:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The fee at University of Texas, Austin is roughly $36,000 for the entire course.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Financial Aid:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Scholarships as such aren&rsquo;t exactly common, but students often apply for RA/TA (Research Assistantship and Teaching Assistantship).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Eventual Placements:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	University of Texas at Austin isn&rsquo;t one of the top universities of the world for nothing. Along with their brilliant faculty and research, they also boast of getting the best of companies visiting them, best of job profiles, and some fantastic salaries being offered to their students.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Most students like Austin because it gives the feel of a small-town (obviously it will. It IS one, isn&rsquo;t it?). You&rsquo;ll often find weird things happening in different parts of Texas, like naked swimming at Hippy Hollow.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Some major areas where you&rsquo;ll see some of the &lsquo;Texas Nightlife&rsquo; are Sixth Street, Red River, etc. Favourite hangouts of students include Chewy&rsquo;s, Magnolia Caf&eacute;, Hula Hut, Iron Cactus, Fuel, Trody&rsquo;s, etc. For any of those nocturnal folks that may be interested, there&rsquo;s Burger King, Magnolia Caf&eacute;, Ihop, Ken&rsquo;s Donuts, etc. And for anyone who wants to get smashed, students recommend &lsquo;Purple&rsquo; at Baby A&rsquo;s. Not bad for a &lsquo;small city&rsquo;.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>James Truchard &amp; William Nowlin</em> - Co-founders of National Instruments</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Robert Cade</em>- Inventor of energy drink Gatorade</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Rex Tillerson</em> - Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Verdict:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Well, give it a shot, but you probably won&rsquo;t get in, unless you have a profile that matches their ambition. Which is pretty bloody high.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Website:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">www.utexas.edu</a></p>
