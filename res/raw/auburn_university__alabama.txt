<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	Auburn University <span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></h1><hr style="font-weight: normal;" /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Preface:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Auburn University is a public research university located in Auburn, Alabama. Founded in 1856, it is one of the most popular university in Alabama, but not exactly that renowned all over. Anyhow, you often find a number of Indians applying to it, mostly as a &lsquo;safe&rsquo; option if they have an average profile.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Location:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Auburn is a tiny little town in the south of the United States, with not much to do, and not too much to look forward to even once you&rsquo;re out, to be honest. The nearest city of any real note is Atlanta, and that too is a good 100 miles or so away. Best of luck.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The modish campus, built over 341 acres, is arranged in a grid like fashion with distinct building groups. The engineering buildings have the business school for company in the northern sector of the central campus. The whole university looks really beautiful, with a lovely blend of some traditional-looking and some modernistic buildings. Many of the research centres are brand new, so you can be forgiven for missing a couple of heartbeats the first time you set foot in them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	As for housing, off-campus apartments are definitely the way to go. Significantly cheaper and far more comfortable than dormitories, off-campus housing is also pretty easy to obtain. Creekside, Logan Square, Garden District, etc have a number of lovely apartments to choose from, and it&rsquo;s always advisable to make sure you have a roommate or two.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Weather:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Auburn experiences a pretty humid climate throughout the year, apart from winters. Summers are warm, but not unpleasant, while winters are cold but not unbearably so. It snows once in a couple of years, but you&rsquo;d best be prepared for it. It rains in winters too, sometimes, so you should have an umbrella at hand. But, all in all, if you ask any student how the weather is, he or she would tell you that it&rsquo;s better than most other places in the country. And that&rsquo;s probably true.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Aerospace Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Biosystems Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Civil Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Computer Science and Software Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Electrical and Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Industrial and Systems Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Materials Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Polymer and Fiber Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Wireless Technology</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Tuition Fees:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Auburn charges a quite reasonable tuition fee of roughly $25,000 per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Financial Aid:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	While it&rsquo;s not too difficult to get some kind of scholarship, it&rsquo;s unfair to expect a bomb unless you have a profile that deserves it. Which, of course, begs the question &ndash; if you have an excellent profile, why come here?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	It&rsquo;s not terribly easy to settle at Auburn if you&rsquo;re used to the hustle and bustle of a big city. Yes, it does get boring at times, but on the bright side, they&rsquo;re a million things to do which you probably wouldn&rsquo;t have the chance, time, or inclination to do were you in, say, NYC. Students often go out hiking, and can be found swimming in the fantastic pool through spring, summer and fall.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	If you like spending most nights drinking yourself silly and most mornings trying to recollect the events of the previous night, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t be too pleased at Auburn. The party scene is conspicuous by its near-absence, and bars in the area are few and far between. Tigris and Bodega are pretty popular, and there are some more joints in Downtown Auburn as well, but that&rsquo;s about it, really.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		Tom Hardy -&nbsp;design strategist, former corporate head of the IBM Design Program</li><br/>	<li>		Jimmy Wales - Co-founder of Wikipedia</li><br/>	<li>		Timothy D. Cook - CEO, Apple Inc.&nbsp;</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Verdict:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The jury is still out on Auburn. While students are full of praise for it, the rankings and the general reputation somewhat tend to disagree.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Website:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.auburn.edu/" target="_blank">www.auburn.edu</a></p>
