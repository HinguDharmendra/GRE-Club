	The computer-based General Test is composed of 3 sections:</p>
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Verbal Reasoning (English)</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Quantitative Reasoning (Math)</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Analytical Writing sections (Two Essays - Issue Task & Argument Task)</li><br/>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	* For the Issue task, two essay topics will be presented and you will choose one. In this type of essay, you usually agree and disagree with the author. There is no need to take a stand. You can state the pros and cons of the topic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	** The Argument task does not present a choice of topics; instead, one topic will be presented. In this type of essay, you should disagree with the author. As the name suggests, you should argue with the author&rsquo;s views.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	After all the verbal and quant sections, a research section follows. This section is like essay writing on a topic presented to you. However, it is NOT evaluated towards the final score. Hence, a lot of people skip this section and proceed to the last part of checking their score.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<em><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></em>The AWA section is always first, followed by two Verbal sections and two Quantitative sections, in any order. Basically, you will have two verbal sections and two quantitative sections and will contribute towards your final score.&nbsp;You will not be informed prior or during the exam about which section will be taken into account and hence you must give cent percent effort in all the sections.</p>
