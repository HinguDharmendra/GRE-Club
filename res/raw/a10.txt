<p style="text-align: justify;">GRE can be taken unlimited number of times with a gap of a minimum of 31 calendar days between 2 tests. (It is highly advisable not to appear for GRE too many times as it may affect the applicant&rsquo;s candidature). However, one can give the test only 5 times in a calendar year.
