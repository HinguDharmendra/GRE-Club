		An SOP is a Statement of Purpose. Purpose means the reason for which something exists. To be precise, it describes you, your goals and intentions which the admission committee will evaluate. An SoP is a document which shows your passion, clarity of thoughts, dedication, inspiration, and most importantly, uniqueness.</p>
