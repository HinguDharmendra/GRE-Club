	The VISA interview is the final hurdle you&#39;ll have to clear before you are well, and truly, on your way. After all the documents you are required to show at the time of the interview, you have to be prepared for the normal drill that the Visa Officer will take you through.Every applicant should take care of the following three things:

<p><strong>Bonafide Student</strong></p>
<p>		The officer will ask about your educational background and plans in order to assess how likely you are to enroll and remain in University until graduation. Be prepared to discuss the reasons you chose a particular University, your anticipated major, and your career plans. Bring school mark sheets, college mark sheets, GRE &amp; TOEFL scores and anything else that demonstrates your academic commitment.</p>

<p><strong>Sponsor</strong></p>
		<p>Your chances are improved if your parents are sponsoring your education. If somebody is sponsoring you other<strong> </strong>than your parents, you should explain your special relationship with this person, who may be committing tens of thousand of dollars to your education.Provide solid evidence of your finances. This will assure the Visa Officer that your sponsor has enough funds till the time you complete Graduation. If your sponsor&rsquo;s income is from several different source (such as salary, contracts or consulting fees, acres of land, rental property, investments) have the sponsor write a letter listing and documenting each<strong> </strong>source of income.</p>

<p><strong>Your ties to the Home Country</strong></p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economic Ties</span>: These include your family&rsquo;s economic position, property you may own and your own economic potential when you come home with a U.S education. The Visa Officer will be impressed to see evidence of your career planning and your knowledge of the local employment scene.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Family &amp; Social Ties</span>: How many close family members live in your home country, compared to those living in the States? What community activities have you participated in that demonstrate a sincere connection to your town or country?Very often, the interview doesn&#39;t even last long enough for the Officer to ask you these few questions. As long as you can maintain your composure and come up with straightforward answers to whatever he asks, you should be fine.
