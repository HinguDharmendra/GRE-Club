Extracurriculars are always an add-on to your profile. Any achievements at the state or national and international level are considered important. Working for social causes such as for an NGO or charity trusts <em>on a regular basis </em>(Please don&rsquo;t start visiting NGOs when your application dates are nearing, it won&rsquo;t help) helps a lot. Participating in college festivals or becoming a head of some committee does not count much.
