	Once you&rsquo;re done with your GRE and obtained a satisfactory score, you will start feeling relaxed thinking, &ldquo;Well, now my job&rsquo;s done&rdquo;. It won&rsquo;t be long enough when you&rsquo;ll realise that appearing for GRE was just the beginning. The major chunk of the work still remains and frustration slowly creeps in because you keep forgetting one thing or the other. Listed below are the important steps that you need to follow after your GRE :</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong><em>- </em></strong><em><strong>Appear for TOEFL:</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	TOEFL isn&rsquo;t an important criterion for withholding your admission process. Basically, TOEFL is a test of your English skills. Its role comes into play at the time of VISA and during your Teaching Assistantship (TA). But it is always better that you are done with all the exams before applying to the universities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<em>Ideal Time:</em><strong> August-September</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	- <em>Deciding your course &amp; university: </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	This is probably the most important and the most hectic time you will go through. You should choose a course purely based on your interest. Usually, students opt for a course based on their undergrad stream, although you can apply to any other different course. The only important part is that you should be able to justify to yourself why you want a course different from your undergrad stream.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Work should begin on deciding a course and a university around <em><strong>September third week</strong></em>, earlier the better.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<em>- Arranging Documents: </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	This is, as usual, tedious and boring. You have to run here and there, from the office on the first floor to the HOD on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor, each will keep dumping the work on the other. &nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t so easy to obtain transcripts, LOR&rsquo;s, attested mark sheets and Bank Statements. As said before, earlier you engage in this work lesser will be the problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Below is a list of documents you should arrange:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Letter Of Recommendations</li><br/>
	<li>Transcripts</li><br/>
	<li>Bank Statement</li><br/>
	<li>Affidavit</li><br/>
	<li>Statement of Purpose</li><br/>
	<li>Resume</li><br/>
	</ul>
