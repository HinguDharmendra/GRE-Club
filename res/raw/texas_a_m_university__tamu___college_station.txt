It is one of the best universities in the States as the research work and the opportunities opening after Graduation is spell bounding.

TAMU is a dream college for IITians and NITians.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Location:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Well, it&rsquo;s not that great, really!&nbsp; Located at College Station, TAMU is the sole attraction of the city. Fortunately, all of Houston, Austin and Dallas are within about three hours from TAMU.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The first thing that we&rsquo;ll strike you about TAMU is its never-ending campus. It is spell over a massive 5200 acres, TAMU is a city within itself. In fact, Kyle Field (the most popular address in College Station) is also within the campus itself. It is completely self sufficient having 8 massive libraries that you can get lost in and enough cafeterias to keep you awake for a lifetime. It has a beautiful recreational centre filled with straight of the art facilities for any kind of sport.<br />	Most graduation students choose to live Off Campus, because it affords them more space, luxury, and freedom. There is a multitude of available apartments near Campus itself and fortunately bus services are pretty good so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about transportation. Scandia and Sterling Apartments are the most common residing options which can cost you anything between $600 to $1000 per month.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Weather: </em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The weather, like in the rest of Texas is pretty hot and humid. Summer temperatures can be as high as 40 degree Celsius while winters are much cooler. College Station occasionally receives some snowfall, but what really troubles you in winters is the biting cold breeze.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Aerospace Engineering</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Biological and Agricultural Engineering</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Biomedical Engineering</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Civil Engineering</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Computer Science</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Electrical Engineering</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Engineering Systems Management</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Health Physics</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Industrial Engineering</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Material Science Engineering</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Nuclear Engineering</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Ocean&nbsp;<span style="text-align: justify;">Engineering</span></li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Petroleum <span style="text-align: justify;">Engineering </span></li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		Safety Engineering</li><br/><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The one thing that can&rsquo;t be questioned is the qualification and brilliance of the professors at TAMU, College Station. However, you may sometimes have some trouble deciphering what they&rsquo;re saying through their thick accents. It&rsquo;s really important to attend all (or most, at least) lectures, since that really goes a long way in determining your grades. Professors are nice people from the inside, even if they seem a bit imposing and condescending from the outside, and they&rsquo;ll be more than willing to help a &lsquo;tryer&rsquo;.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Fees:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	TAMU charges a relatively low tuition fee of $13,000 per annum (covers 18 credits).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Financial Aid:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	How much cheaper do you want it to be? Financial aid is almost as less as 5% but almost everyone gets a Research Assistantship and Teaching Assistantship based on their performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Eventual Placements:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Since TAMU is one of the better colleges around, it certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem getting a pretty-high-paying job once you&rsquo;re here. Where you get placed naturally depends on the course you&rsquo;re doing, but more often than not, you can expect to get picked up by one of the top players in whatever field you&rsquo;re specializing in.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The sheer size of TAMU means that you can find just about every kind of person on campus, ranging from the absolute nerds to those who just can&rsquo;t stop partying. Although it must be known that there really isn&rsquo;t much to do once you&rsquo;re out of the campus, so it&rsquo;s important &ndash; no, its imperative &ndash; that you find some people who you can hang out and party with.<br />	The only place that really offers any kind of nightlife is Northgate, and there are a number of restaurants and bars that students hang out at, the most popular ones namely Dixie Chicken, Cheddar&rsquo;s, Fox &amp; Hound, Hurricane Harry&rsquo;s and The Tap.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Michael Bonsignore</em> - Chairman and CEO at Honeywell</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		<em>O.Wayne Crisman</em>- President, CEO and Chairman at Gulf Oil</li><br/><br/><br/>	<li>		<em>Lawrence Fouraker</em> - Former Dean, Harvard Business School</li><br/><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	<em style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.2;">Verdict:</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">	In all probability, you won&rsquo;t get it. If you do, you should probably take it. The opportunities are endless, but prepare for two years of small-city life.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Website:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">www.tamu.edu</a></p>
