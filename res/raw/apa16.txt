		SoP is basically an essay and a major chunk of it will be boring. However, it is the most important document which means it will take a lot of your time. Start working on it from around <em>1<sup>st</sup> week of October </em>(if you&rsquo;re applying for Fall). It&rsquo;s not an essay on a political leader which will get over in a day. You have to make several rough drafts, keep on editing, get it proof-read by your seniors and then you will have your final copy ready.</p>
