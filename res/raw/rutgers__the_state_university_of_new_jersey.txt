<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey</h1><hr style="text-align: justify;" /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Preface:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, adorably called as Rutgers or Rutgers University, is a public research university located in the small city of Newark in New Jersey. Founded in 1766, Rutgers is one of the high ranking universities in the States which mean you need a mind blowing profile to get in. Earlier know as the Newark School of Engineering, the institution is very famous for its Electrical and Computer Engineering program especially Wireless. It&rsquo;s a dream college for an above average profile and generally students having achievements through their undergraduate course make it to this college.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Location:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Well, probably by now you must have figured it out, the location of the college. Yes, it&rsquo;s located in Newark, one of the largest cities in the state of New Jersey. The striking feature of this location is that it&rsquo;s situated centrally from the happening cities of USA - Boston, New York City, Baltimore, Washington DC and Philadelphia - thus giving Rutgers a big thumbs up. &nbsp;New Jersey is the third wealthiest state in US of A, all thanks to its location and New York primarily.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The campus at Rutgers is spread over a massive 2,700 acres and you really wonder what they&rsquo;ve in this huge size? Apart from the hundreds of buildings, some of which need to go under construction while some are way to modern, there are more than 10 main libraries encompassing around millions of volumes of various courses. Multiple student study centre, many recreational centers, followed by cafeterias, completes the infrastructure of Rutgers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	While there are many dorms within the campus charging you roughly around $7,000, most of the students prefer to stay off campus for obvious reasons. One thing is for sure, when you&rsquo;re at New Jersey, living expenses are going to be really heavy on your daddy&rsquo;s pocket. Easton Avenue and Hamilton Avenue are the popular and the hot favourite places where you see Rutger-ites residing. The rental charges starts roughly from $800 to $2,000 depending upon the size of the room and the number of roommates.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Weather: </em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Summers are particularly hot and humid, while winters are bearably cold. Since Atlantic ocean is adjacent to the city of Newark, generally the winters are warmer as compared to the other cities lying on the same belt. Rarely do you see snowfall during Christmas time. All in all, winters are easy to bear, hence Indian students love it more.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Courses Offered:</em></strong></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Bioenvironmental Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Biomedical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Chemical and Biochemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Civil and Environmental Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Electrical and Computer Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Industrial and Systems Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Material Science and Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	As Rutgers is associated with the Association of American Universities, the professors here are just class apart.

They&rsquo;re friendly, helpful (obviously, if you approach them) and amicable, though opinions will differ on this statement as barely few of them are arrogant and stubborn.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Tuition Fees:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	As Rutgers is the state university of New Jersey, it charges you an affordable tuition fee of around $26,000 per annum.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Financial Aid:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	C&rsquo;mon!

While the ratio of boys and girls are the same, looks and appearance wise, there are definitely more chicks and studs. Boys, thank god!<br />	When New York City is probably a few kilometers away, how can nightlife be out of the question? &nbsp;With thousands of pubs, discotheques, bars and restaurants round the corner, LIFE at Rutgers is always on the rocks. To name a few places and restaurants nearby the institution are Easton Avenue, Frat Row, George Street, The Knight Club, McCormick&rsquo;s Pub, The Olive Branch, Atlantic City, and everything you want under the sun.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Peter C.
