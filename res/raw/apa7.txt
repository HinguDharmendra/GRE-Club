	You can apply to as many universities as you wish, with only one factor restricting you, MONEY! Yes, the cost is pretty heavy on your pocket. On an average one application costs you around $100. Sure you want to know what costs so much. The split is as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Online application form: $60 approx. (<em>varies from $50 to $100 depending upon the university</em>)</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Reporting your GRE score through ETS: $23 (official scores are compulsory)</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Reporting your TOEFL score through ETS: $17 (official scores are compulsory)</li><br/>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Now, there is no rule book to how many universities an applicant should consider and whether it&#39;s easy or difficult to get in but generally, students apply to 8-10 universities with 4 ambitious, 3 moderate and 2 safes (Huh?!? What&rsquo;s this??)</p>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<em>Ambitious:</em> An ambitious university means the acceptance rate is low and the best profile gets in.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<em>Moderate:</em> A moderate university means the acceptance rate is medium and the chances of making to these universities are above average or somewhat realistic for your profile.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		<em>Safe:</em> By now you would have understood what does safe mean. Yes, it means the acceptance rate is pretty high and the chances of getting through are very high (though it is never 100%)</li><br/>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<em><strong>Caution: </strong></em>Don&rsquo;t apply to all safe universities so that you get more admits. There&rsquo;s no point of getting an accept from all the safe ones. Getting at least one admit from an ambitious university should be the target. One admit from an ambitious <strong><em>wins over</em></strong> many admits from safes.</p>
