There are two main libraries within the campus which has hundreds thousands of volumes of various courses offered within the college. There are multiple bars on the campus followed by many coffee shops where you see most of the students chilling and wasting their time. Movie lovers can spend their time in the Johnson Cinema Centre within the campus.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	There are many dorms within the campus which roughly cost you around $5,000 per year. But graduate students prefer to stay off campus for multiple obvious reasons. As Fairfax County is pretty close to Washington DC, one cannot expect cheap affordability. Fairfax Square Apartments, Margate Manor and Old Town (walking distance from the main campus) are the standard areas preferred by the students of GMU. Roughly, the average rental can be anything from around $1,200 to $1,500 per month depending upon the location, size of the room and the number of roommates.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Weather:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Virginia has a pretty extreme temperature. As the state is located far in east and towards the south, summers are scorching hot. The temperature goes up to 30 to 40 degrees at the start of Fall and Indians obviously feel like home.

All are PhD holders with a few Noble laureates from various universities making GMU&rsquo;s teaching staff quite a vivid one. The teachers are pretty enthusiastic during their lecture hours and are always ready to solve doubts. Most of them are busy doing their own research but balance student doubts and teaching to a very good level. They are co-operative provided you make a move and have been in regular touch with them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Tuition Fees:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	George Mason University empties your pocket by $1200 per credit. For the entire course, you can expect to have around 27 to 30 credits. So, the total tuition fee can be around $35,000.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	Financial Aid:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Being a public research university, George Mason offers enough grants and financial aid depending upon the level of profile.

Reputed MNC&rsquo;s visit the college at the time of placements but as mentioned before, the college begin a low rank university doesn&rsquo;t offer &lsquo;great&rsquo; placements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	George Mason being the largest school in the city has student from all possible backgrounds and countries. Thousands of Whites, followed by Latin&rsquo;s, Asians (yes, Indians primarily) and Africans comprises the diversity of GMU. Boys and girls are in equal number with the latter being the attractive ones.<br />	Sadly, Fairfax is not one of the happening cities in the USA and most students end up doing/or going for house parties. Some popular areas with nightlife would be Old Town Fairfax, Downtown Washington DC, Adams Morgan and George Town where you find multiple food stalls and restaurants like Amphora, Denny&rsquo;s, Pad Thai Restaurant, the famous Starbucks, 7-11, Domino&rsquo;s and everything you want under the sun.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Verdict:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	George Mason University is an average moderate ranking university in the States. Decent weather, above average placement and Washington DC at stone throw distance, not literally, makes this school a good bet for just an average profile.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Website: </em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">www.gmu.edu</a></p>
