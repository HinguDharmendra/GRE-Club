<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	Indiana University at Bloomington (IUB)</h1><hr style="text-align: justify;" /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Preface:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Indiana University is a public research university founded in 1820 in the city of Bloomington. As Bloomington is the flagship campus of the Indiana University system, it is usually referred as IU or simply Indiana. The university is very famous among Asians especially Indians and is definitely a hot favourite for a Computer Science (and Information Technology) aspirant. The university is more popuar for its Management Information System (MIS) program which comes under the Management school - Kelley School of Business. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Previously, an average profile could quite easily make it to this college but over the last few years, admission standards have considerably been augmented. We, still, feel the chances to get in are pretty good for average profiles though seniors believe that admissions are now erratic like Georgia Tech and USC.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Location:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	As the name suggests, the university is located in the city of Bloomington. Though there are 4 other cities with the same name in the States (this is pretty common, you&#39;ll learn - it&#39;s a funny country), we&rsquo;re talking about the one in the state of Indiana of course. Bloomington, a small yet pretty famous city, is well known for the education it delivers. IUB is a university town and thus you don&#39;t see a flourshing lifestyle like New York or the Bay area.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	IUB&rsquo;s campus is spread over a massive 1860 acres with more than 100 buildings. There are two main libraries which cover tens of thousands of volumes of all the possible courses offered in the university. Indiana Memorial Union is one of the popular places within the campus, where you find most of the students chilling, bowling and watching movies over the weekend - basically, having a good time. Of course, some nerds study as well. With a few cafeterias within the campus and bars at a stones throw distance, the infrastructure is pretty self satisfying.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	There are roughly 11 dorms on campus and the rental charges is around $5,000 per year. Anyhow, most of the students prefer staying off campus where the rent charges are anything from $450 to $600 per month, depending upon the size of the room. Undoubtedly, off campus apartments are way better than the dorms in the campus. The common areas where you see IUB students residing are Varsity Villas, Hoosier Courts and Smallwood Plaza.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Weather: </em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Bloomington is known for its erratic and extreme temperatures. Summers are quite hot and humid while the winters are pretty cold. November onwards, the weather gets colder and colder with snowfall arriving in the early December. The temperature goes roughly up to minus 15 degrees. Spring is the season of rainfall and you see roads wet and slippery all the time. The notable feature of the weather at Bloomington is that there&rsquo;s a lot of humidity throughout the year including winters and thus Indians always feel like home.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3>	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		Biochemistry</li><br/>	<li>		Computer Science</li><br/>	<li>		Environmental Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Informatics and Computing</li><br/>	<li>		Telecommunications</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The professors at IUB are extremely knowledgeable and have done their Phd&rsquo;s from excellent universities in the world. Though most of them are still busy doing their research, they are pretty flexible and approachable, definitely not at odd hours. Students are quite satisfied with the level of teaching at Indiana University but in terms of nature, most of them are just average while a few are pretty strict and stern. An IUB-ite quoted, &ldquo;If you submit all your assignments and projects on time, you definitely are in the good books of most of the professors.&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Tuition Fees:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Even though IUB is a state funded university, it costs you a tuition fee of around $30,000 for the entire course.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Financial Aid:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Indiana University, a Public Ivy League University, requires enough achievements in your profile to grant you some Financial Aid. Part time jobs are pretty easy to get depending upon where your interest lies. Also Teaching and Research Assistantship aren&rsquo;t a problem provided you maintain your CGPA and submit your assignments time to time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Eventual Placements:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	There are various job openings in the field of Computer Science (hardware and software) with big and well known MNC&rsquo;s recruiting students within the campus. Since it&rsquo;s the best college in the state, the placements are excellent and the starting salary can be anything from around $40,000.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Girls at the IUB outnumber the boys by a bit but you see overall a good, mixing crowd. While the whites are definitely the majority, next in line are the Asians, Indians primarily. Overall, students are pretty satisfied with the level of crowd at Bloomington.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Apart from the multiple cafes and bars within the campus, students love to hangout in areas like Downtown Square, Kirkwood Avenue, Town Square Area has pretty much a happening crowd. There are millions of restaurants and pubs in these areas; to name a few - Bluebird, Kilroy&rsquo;s on Kirkwood, Kilroy&rsquo;s Sports Bar, Village Deli and Mothers Bears. The nightlife at Indiana is certainly great just like any other university with students preferring a pub, discotheque or house as their party venue.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Jimmy Wales</em> - Co-founder of Wikipedia</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Harold Arthur Poling</em> - Retired Chairman and CEO of Ford Motor Company</li><br/>	<li>		<em>John Chambers</em> - President and CEO of Cisco Systems</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Verdict:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Good job opportunities&rsquo; considering the strategic location and decent crowd puts IUB in the good league of universities. Famous for its Computer Science program followed by Kelley School of Business (for MIS course), Indiana University at Bloomington is a good bet for any average profile.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Website: </em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.iub.edu/" target="_blank">www.iub.edu</a></p>
