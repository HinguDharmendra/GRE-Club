<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	Columbia University in the City of New York</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em><strong>Preface:</strong></em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The Fu Foundation School of Engineering of the Columbia University is a private research institute started in 1896. The fifth-oldest university in the United States, CU has achieved Ivy League status thanks to its standing amongst the elite. It is one of the more sought-after schools around, but it isn&rsquo;t impossible to get in, provided your academics are more-than-decent, and you&rsquo;ve done a fair share of some kind of research work.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Location:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Columbia University is located in the tremendously upmarket Manhattan district of New York. There&rsquo;s really nothing else to say, is there? Manhattan! THE Manhattan!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	The subway station and a major bus stop are right outside the gate of Columbia University, so travelling is pretty convenient for all students, regardless of where they stay.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Infrastructure and Residing options:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	There are 20 major libraries in the Columbia University campus. There is the popular Blue Java Coffee Bar on campus as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Living on campus is an option, but the number of dorms is limited, plus it&rsquo;s pretty expensive. Average cost per year is about $6000 per year, and that doesn&rsquo;t account for some of the major costs. That&rsquo;s why most graduate students normally live off campus.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Weather: </em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	In spite of New York&rsquo;s proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, the city does tend to have somewhat extreme climate; the summers are warm and the winters are cold. Temperatures in winter can fall as low as -10&deg;C during nights, and in summer can go as high as 34&deg;C during the afternoon. New York receives a fair share of rainfall, especially during spring.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics</li><br/>	<li>		Biomedical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics</li><br/>	<li>		Computer Science</li><br/>	<li>		Earth and environmental Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Electrical Engineering</li><br/>	<li>		Industrial Engineering and Operations Research</li><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Now, the faculty is excellent, as you would probably expect in one of the best colleges in the world, which is located in one of the best cities in the world. But with such excellence comes a sense of expectation out of others. Students are often berated a bit if they aren&rsquo;t able to live up to professors expectations, and they would do well not to get into the bad books of the rather egoistic professors. But having said that, if students are sincere and committed, getting along with faculty members becomes quite a cakewalk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Fees:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Columbia University charges a rather prohibitive tuition fee of roughly $1,500 per credit. There are roughly 27 to 30 credits during the entire course. You can do the math, can&#39;t you?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Financial Aid:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Since it&rsquo;s a private institute, and a highly reputed one for that, scholarships are almost impossible to get. Students may apply for Teaching Assistantships though.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Eventual Placements:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	This is something you really shouldn&rsquo;t be worrying about. You&rsquo;ll definitely get a job, and a pretty good one, too. The fees you pay at Columbia seems like pocket change once you get yourself placed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd and Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	You see a very diverse crowd at Columbia University, though you&rsquo;ll notice that most students come from pretty strong financial backgrounds. There isn&rsquo;t exactly too much of a &lsquo;campus life&rsquo;, so to speak, but this is because of the university&rsquo;s location in the heart of NYC. Most students aren&rsquo;t involved in sports or other college-level activities, and there&rsquo;s hardly any &lsquo;Greek Life&rsquo; at Columbia. But this is no way means that life is boring. Oh no. Not at all. On the contrary, there isn&rsquo;t ever a moment of boredom, because of the PLETHORA of bars, restaurants, theaters, coffee shops, and just about anything else in Manhattan.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	Although there&rsquo;s normally a decent percentage of pretty girls (and charming boys), you shouldn&rsquo;t be troubled even if there isn&rsquo;t. There are millions out there in NYC. Just get out, you&rsquo;ll know. They say that if you can&rsquo;t get hooked up in Manhattan, you should probably give it up altogether.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Vikram Pandit</em> - CEO of Citigroup</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Stephen Friedman</em> - Chairman of Goldman Sachs, National Economic Council director</li><br/>	<li>		<em>Warren Buffett </em>- President of Berkshire Hathaway&nbsp;</li><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Verdict:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	If you can afford it, go right ahead. You won&rsquo;t regret it, we promise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<strong><em>Website:</em></strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">www.columbia.edu</a></p>
