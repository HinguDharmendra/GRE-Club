		First and foremost, you need a credit card. You are going to pay a hefty amount (around 60,000/- INR) for applying to around 8-10 universities; so you can&rsquo;t keep knocking on your relatives or friends doors for a credit card.</li><br/>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		Go to the particular university&rsquo;s website and see the tab for <strong><em>prospective students or apply now. </em></strong>See to it that you select the graduate section as there will be a lot of data on the website which will be general for both undergrad and grad students.</li><br/>

		The forms are generally quite long extending upto 7-8 pages and you are bound to get bored and restless. But, make sure you are careful while filling the form and use the autosave facility available in all application forms.</li><br/>

	<em><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong></em> Start filling the form even if your SOP isn&rsquo;t ready (usually it&rsquo;s not ready). Enter your recommender&rsquo;s email address as early as possible. The university will send an email to them and they will complete the rest of the procedure. Recommender&rsquo;s are EXTREMELY SLOW. You have to keep reminding them frequently.</p>
