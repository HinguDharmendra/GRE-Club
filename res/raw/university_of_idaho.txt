<h1 style="text-align: justify;">	University of Idaho</h1><hr /><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Preface</em>:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The University of Idaho is the oldest and flagship public institute of the State of Idaho. Founded in 1889, the university isn&rsquo;t particularly great for any course, but we decided to put up a review because a few of you who don&rsquo;t get in anywhere else sometimes end up applying here out of desperation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Location</em>:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	U of I (as it&rsquo;s called in these parts) is located in the extremely tiny rural town of Moscow (no, not that Moscow). If that isn&rsquo;t enough to put you off, there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing worth a mention for miles and miles. The nearest &lsquo;big&rsquo; cities are Seattle and Portland, and both are about 500km away. Oh dear.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Infrastructure and Residing Options:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The campus is a huge 1600 acres, and thank god that it is, because there is absolutely nothing in the &lsquo;city&rsquo; of Moscow apart from University of Idaho. Most of the buildings are quite old and look like they could use some repairing, but the interiors (classrooms, laboratories, washrooms) are pretty well-maintained. There&rsquo;s a state of the art athletics centre, as well as a students&rsquo; recreation centre which everyone can use. The library system is quite excellent; you don&rsquo;t find students complaining about a lack of books, presumably because there isn&rsquo;t a lack of books. A negative part about the college may be the fact that there isn&rsquo;t much to do here in terms of entertainment &ndash; no bars, and the recreation centre isn&rsquo;t great either.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	As far as living is concerned, there are a number of options available. There are students who live in the dorms, but they&rsquo;re outnumbered by those who choose to live off-campus. Since Moscow is a small place, rents are quite low, but you need to search for houses well in advance. It also makes sense to have a couple of roommates; not only to split the rent, but also to kill some time in a lonely place.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Weather</em>:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	To repeat an earlier joke, this isn&rsquo;t THAT Moscow. But you can be forgiven for mistaking the two, because it&rsquo;s terribly cold for most of the year here. They have roughly three months of warm sunshine, but the rest of the time it&rsquo;s snowy, rainy and chilly. Summers are hot and dry, so basically there really isn&rsquo;t any part of the year that you can look forward to.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Courses Offered:</em></h3><ul style="text-align: justify;">	<li>		Biological and Agricultural Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Chemical Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Computer Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Computer Science</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Electrical Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Engineering Management</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Civil Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Material Science and Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Mechanical Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Nuclear Engineering</li><br/><br/>	<li>		Technology Management</li><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Faculty and Pedagogy:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	It&rsquo;s always advisable to be an independent learner. This is not to say that the teachers aren&rsquo;t up to the mark &ndash; most of them certainly are &ndash; but every once in a while it&rsquo;s possible to come across a professor who isn&rsquo;t completely interested in teaching, because he/she has enough research work on his/her plate already. However, almost all professors are very approachable and help students out in any problems they may have. Passing your courses should never be a problem as long as you study once in a while, and do your homework regularly. That&rsquo;s what really matters, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Fees</em>:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The tuition fee at University of Idaho is roughly $20,000 per semester (9 or more credits) which, accoding to us, is very expensive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Crowd &amp; Campus Life:</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	The crowd isn&rsquo;t as multicultural as you would see at most other American universities, but it&rsquo;s quite good nevertheless. You can always find people to get along with; people who share similar interests and hobbies. You may not find the most intellectually simulating people around, but then again if you&rsquo;ve ended up at Idaho, there&rsquo;s a good chance that you aren&rsquo;t Einstein either, so don&rsquo;t let it bother you.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	The nightlife isn&rsquo;t too great here &ndash; there are a number of parties in the dorms and in the houses near college, but you need to be invited to them, so you better start making some friends soon after you arrive. Other than that, there are a few bars, but none of them are all that great, which is why students prefer staying home.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Placements</em>:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	University of Idaho has a pretty helpful Career Centre, but it&rsquo;s not terribly easy to get jobs. The not-very-great college isn&rsquo;t helped by the fact that it&rsquo;s, well, in the middle of nowhere.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Famous Alumni:</em></h3><ul>	<li>		<em>Sharon Allen</em> - Chairman of Board for Deloiite &amp; Touche</li><br/><br/>	<li>		<em>Frank Shrontz</em> - Former Chairman and CEO of Boeing</li><br/><br/></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Verdict</em>:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	Not the best of colleges. If you think you can do better, you probably can.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">	&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">	<em>Website: </em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">	<a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank">www.uidaho.edu</a></p>
